# Fee change from fee on transfer tokens will severely harm the protocol

### Summary

Fee on transfer tokens may change their fee at any time which will mess up completely the accounting of all functionality in `AmirX` and [StablecoinHandler](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-telcoin/blob/main/telcoin-audit/contracts/stablecoin/StablecoinHandler.sol#L144).

### Root Cause

In both `AmirX` and `StablecoinHandler`, fee on transfers are dealt with by simply changing the ratio from `ss.oAmount` to `ss.tAmount`, that is, instead of swapping for example 1000 tokens A for 1000 B, they know tokens A have a 1% fee on transfer so they swap 1010 tokens A for 1000 tokens B. However, the fee may change at any time and become 2% or 0.5%, which will mess up the accounting and make the protocol take a loss or the user.

### Internal pre-conditions

None.

### External pre-conditions

Fee on transfer tokens change their fee and frontrun stablecoin swap calls.

### Attack Path

1. Fee on transfer tokens change their fee.
2. Any function that does a `_stablecoinSwap()` in `AmirX` or `StablecoinHandler` is called.

The simplest example is calling `StablecoinHandler::stablecoinSwap()` with an amount of USDC of 1010.10 to receive 1000 eUSDC (assuming USDC has a 1% fee although it does not currently). If the fee changes to 2% frontrunning this call, the 1010.10 USDC will only send to the `liquiditySafe` an amount of `1010.10 * 98 / 100 = 989.9` instead of 1000 USDC, taking the protocol the loss.

### Impact

The protocol takes losses whenever a token changes the value of the fee on transfer or the user is penalized if the fee decreases instead.

### PoC

```solidity
function _stablecoinSwap(
    address wallet,
    StablecoinSwap memory ss
) internal {
    if (
        ss.stablecoinFeeCurrency != address(0) &&
        ss.stablecoinFeeSafe != address(0)
    )
        ERC20PermitUpgradeable(ss.stablecoinFeeCurrency).safeTransferFrom(
            wallet,
            ss.stablecoinFeeSafe,
            ss.feeAmount
        );

    // Handle the transfer or burning of the origin currency:
    // If the origin is a recognized stablecoin (XYZ), burn the specified amount from the wallet.
    if (isXYZ(ss.origin)) {
        Stablecoin(ss.origin).burnFrom(wallet, ss.oAmount);
    } else {
        ERC20PermitUpgradeable(ss.origin).safeTransferFrom(
            wallet,
            ss.liquiditySafe,
            ss.oAmount 
        );
    }

    // Handle the minting or transferring of the target currency:
    // If the target is a recognized stablecoin (XYZ), mint the required amount to the destination address.
    if (isXYZ(ss.target)) {
        Stablecoin(ss.target).mintTo(ss.destination, ss.tAmount);
    } else {
        ERC20PermitUpgradeable(ss.target).safeTransferFrom( //@audit stuck if target becomes xyz
            ss.liquiditySafe,
            ss.destination,
            ss.tAmount 
        );
    }
}
```

### Mitigation

Add checks to `StablecoinHandler::_stablecoinSwap()` to ensure the fees applied in the transfers match the expected values used when calculating `ss.oAmount` and `ss.tAmount`.
