# Audit Report: Missing Checks for Fee Currency and Fee Safe Address

### Summary

Audit Report: Missing Checks for Fee Currency and Fee Safe Address
[StablecoinHandler](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-telcoin/blob/main/telcoin-audit/contracts/stablecoin/StablecoinHandler.sol) contract, it was identified that the contract does not properly verify the presence of critical addresses for the fee mechanism in the StablecoinSwap struct. Specifically, the stablecoinFeeCurrency and stablecoinFeeSafe properties were not being checked to ensure they are not set to address(0), which could lead to unintended behavior or failed transactions if the fee addresses are not properly configured.

### Root Cause

The absence of validation checks for the stablecoinFeeCurrency and stablecoinFeeSafe addresses within the contract is the root cause of this issue. These addresses are used to define where the fees are transferred and in which currency the fees should be paid. If these addresses are not properly specified (i.e., set to address(0)), the contract will attempt to perform operations that could fail or lead to a loss of funds, impacting the protocol's reliability.

### Internal pre-conditions

_stablecoinSwap enter wallet and ss info

### Attack Path

Attacker Sets Fee Addresses to Zero (address(0)): The attacker initiates a swap transaction by providing valid parameters, except for the fee addresses (stablecoinFeeCurrency and stablecoinFeeSafe), which are set to address(0) (the zero address).

Since the contract does not currently check that these addresses are non-zero, the transaction proceeds without any validation or errors.

Attacker Executes the Swap: The attacker proceeds to execute the swap. The contract will attempt to transfer the fee from the wallet to the zero address for both the fee currency and fee safe address. This transfer will fail because:

The zero address is an invalid address for ERC20 transfers.
The safeTransferFrom function will fail, but since there are no explicit checks to prevent such an operation, the contract might not revert at this point, leading to undefined behavior.

### Impact

The failure to validate the **stablecoinFeeCurrency** and **stablecoinFeeSafe** addresses before executing transactions could have the following impacts:

Failed Transactions: If the stablecoinFeeCurrency or stablecoinFeeSafe is set to address(0), the transaction may revert when the contract attempts to transfer fees or mint/burn tokens.

Liquidity Management Issues: Missing fee addresses could result in an inability to properly collect or distribute fees, leading to potential liquidity issues for the contract.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Add require

```solidity
require(ss.stablecoinFeeCurrency != address(0), "StablecoinHandler: Fee currency not specified");
require(ss.stablecoinFeeSafe != address(0), "StablecoinHandler: Fee safe address not specified");
```
