# The `swap` function may not perform `defiSwap` when `directional` is true.

### Summary

When `directional` is true, `defiSwap` should always be executed. However, the current implementation allows for the possibility of not executing `defiSwap`, which could lead to users unexpectedly having their funds swapped.

### Root Cause

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-telcoin/blob/main/telcoin-audit/contracts/swap/AmirX.sol#L90
The `wallet.length` should be restricted to be greater than 0.

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. directional is true, but walletData is zero
2. fBalance - iBalance == 0 ss.origin is not overrided.
3. The assets originally in the wallet could potentially be swapped.

### Impact

The assets originally in the wallet could potentially be swapped.

### Mitigation

```diff
            else {
                // if defi then stablecoin swap
                //check balance to adjust second swap
                uint256 iBalance = ERC20(ss.origin).balanceOf(wallet);
-               if (defi.walletData.length != 0) _defiSwap(wallet, defi);
+               if (defi.walletData.length == 0) revert();
+               _defiSwap(wallet, defi);
                uint256 fBalance = ERC20(ss.origin).balanceOf(wallet);
                //change balance to reflect change
                if (fBalance - iBalance != 0) ss.oAmount = fBalance - iBalance;
                _stablecoinSwap(wallet, ss);
            }
