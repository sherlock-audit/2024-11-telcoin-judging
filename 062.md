# Fee-on-Transfer Tokens May Cause Insufficient/Reduced Balances in ss.liquiditySafe, ss.stablecoinFeeSafe, and defi.defiSafe

### Summary

The reliance on direct token transfers in `_stablecoinSwap` and `_feeDispersal` without validating the actual token balances will cause insufficient/reduced balances in `ss.liquiditySafe`, `ss.stablecoinFeeSafe`, and `defi.defiSafe` as fee-on-transfer tokens deduct a portion of the transferred amount, leading to future transaction failures or reverts when those balances are insufficient to make a transfer from `ss.liquiditySafe` to `ss.destination`.

Note: The contest details specify "user's might get less than expected", but NOT the protocol. Additionally, per the sponsor's confirmation, FOT are not in the contract prior. When the wallet does the defi swap some of the funds are sent to the user and the fee is sent to AmirX. Previously the Swapper sent this fund in but that's not what they want here; they should want to use the balance that is sent back from AmirX.

### Root Cause

In [StablecoinHandler.sol](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-telcoin/blob/main/telcoin-audit/contracts/stablecoin/StablecoinHandler.sol#L155) and [AmirX.sol](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-telcoin/blob/main/telcoin-audit/contracts/swap/AmirX.sol#L247-L251), the protocol does not account for fee-on-transfer behavior in the following scenarios:

1. `_stablecoinSwap`: When transferring fee-on-transfer tokens to `ss.liquiditySafe` or from `ss.liquiditySafe` to `ss.destination`, the intermediary balance may not match the expected amount. The same shall apply when transferring from `wallet` to `ss.stablecoinFeeSafe`.
2. `_feeDispersal` and `_buyBack`: Fee-on-transfer tokens converted to TELCOIN result in less TELCOIN being deposited into `defi.defiSafe`.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. Swapper Role initiates a swap where `ss.origin` or `ss.target` is a fee-on-transfer token.
2. A portion of the token amount is deducted as a transfer fee.
3. Swapper Role assumes the nominal `ss.oAmount` will fully transfer without validating post-transfer balances. This also incurs protocol loss for the reduced amount received by `ss.stablecoinFeeSafe`
4. TELCOIN buybacks convert fee-on-transfer tokens with reduced amounts reaching `defi.defiSafe`.

### External pre-conditions

1. The protocol integrates with fee-on-transfer tokens for swaps or buybacks.
2. Fee-on-transfer tokens are held by `wallet` and used as `ss.origin`, `ss.target`, or `feeToken` for buyback operations.

### Attack Path

Scenario 1: Insufficient `ss.liquiditySafe` Balance

Transaction A: `ss.origin` is a fee-on-transfer token.
- When transferring to [`ss.stablecoinFeeSafe`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-telcoin/blob/main/telcoin-audit/contracts/stablecoin/StablecoinHandler.sol#L154) and [`ss.liquiditySafe`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-telcoin/blob/main/telcoin-audit/contracts/stablecoin/StablecoinHandler.sol#L165), the received amount is less than expected.
Transaction B: `ss.target` is a fee-on-transfer token.
- `ss.liquiditySafe` attempts to transfer [`ss.tAmount` to `ss.destination`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-telcoin/blob/main/telcoin-audit/contracts/stablecoin/StablecoinHandler.sol#L175-L179).
- If Transaction A and B involve the same nominal amount, the reduced balance in `ss.liquiditySafe` will cause Transaction B to fail.

Scenario 2: Reduced `defi.defiSafe` Balance

- The protocol collects fee-on-transfer tokens and converts them to TELCOIN during [`_buyBack`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-telcoin/blob/main/telcoin-audit/contracts/swap/AmirX.sol#L247-L251).
- Due to the transfer fee, less TELCOIN is deposited into [`defi.defiSafe`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-telcoin/blob/main/telcoin-audit/contracts/swap/AmirX.sol#L211).

Scenario 3: Reduced `ss.stablecoinFeeSafe` Balance

- Fee-on-transfer tokens are transferred to [`ss.stablecoinFeeSafe`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-telcoin/blob/main/telcoin-audit/contracts/stablecoin/StablecoinHandler.sol#L154).
- The safe receives less than the expected fee amount, leading to discrepancies in protocol fee accounting.

### Impact

- The protocol suffers transaction reverts or operational failures due to insufficient balances in `ss.liquiditySafe`, and a direct loss in `defi.defiSafe`, and `ss.stablecoinFeeSafe`.
- This disrupts core swap and fee-handling functionalities, potentially leading to loss of user trust and protocol downtime/losses.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

After transferring tokens, compare pre- and post-transfer balances to ensure the correct amounts are received. This should concern only the protocol per the readme detail. For instance, the following logic may be incorporated in `_stablecoinSwap()` when handling the transfer of the origin currency:

```solidity
uint256 preBalance = IERC20(ss.origin).balanceOf(ss.liquiditySafe);
IERC20(ss.origin).safeTransferFrom(wallet, ss.liquiditySafe, ss.oAmount);
uint256 postBalance = IERC20(ss.origin).balanceOf(ss.liquiditySafe);
require(postBalance - preBalance >= ss.oAmount, "Insufficient tokens received due to fee-on-transfer.");
```
