# Fee on Transfer Tokens Will Cause Protocol to Lose Funds

### Summary

The failure to account for ERC20 tokens with a fee on transfer will cause the protocol to receive fewer fees than intended. When users perform token swaps, the fees that should be transferred to the protocol’s fee pool are reduced due to the fee on transfer mechanism in certain tokens. As a result, the protocol is unable to accumulate the full amount of fees, leading to a reduction in the available funds to carry out the intended operations, such as backing the stablecoin or maintaining liquidity. This reduction in fees affects the overall functioning and financial stability of the protocol.

### Root Cause

The issue lies in the failure to account for ERC20 tokens with a fee on transfer in the contract's logic. In the function `_stablecoinSwap()`, when fees are supposed to be transferred to the protocol's fee pool, ERC20 tokens with a fee on transfer cause a discrepancy in the amount received. The fee on transfer reduces the value transferred, meaning that the protocol is not receiving the full fee amount as intended. This results in a lower fee accumulation, impacting the protocol’s financial operations.

In the function `_stablecoinSwap()` [(Github Link)](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-telcoin/blob/b9c751b59e78a7123a636e31ecafc9147046f190/telcoin-audit/contracts/stablecoin/StablecoinHandler.sol#L152-L156) when fees are supposed to be transferred to the protocol's fee pool, ERC20 tokens with a fee on transfer cause a discrepancy in the amount received. The fee on transfer reduces the value transferred, meaning that the protocol is not receiving the full fee amount as intended. This results in a lower fee accumulation, impacting the protocol’s financial operations.

Additionally, in the function `_buyBack()` [(Github Link)](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-telcoin/blob/b9c751b59e78a7123a636e31ecafc9147046f190/telcoin-audit/contracts/swap/AmirX.sol#L250-L251), where the fee is meant to be forwarded to the safe address, the transfer amount is also reduced due to the fee on transfer, meaning the contract is not receiving the expected amount to forward.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. The contract must be called by a user performing a token swap where the origin token has a fee on transfer.
2. The swap must involve an ERC20 token with a fee on transfer (such as a token like POL).
3. The user must complete the swap, triggering the fee transfer to the protocol’s fee pool.

### Impact

The protocol suffers a reduction in the amount of fees it receives from swaps, resulting in a lower total fee accumulation for the protocol’s fee pool. This impacts the protocol's financial sustainability, as the expected fees for operations are not fully collected. The protocol’s available funds to back operations, liquidity, or other intended use cases are reduced, which could affect its overall stability and performance.
