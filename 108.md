# Protocol cannot be integrated with 0x

### Summary

The protocol is designed to interact with 0x and 1inch as swap mechanisms to convert the fee token into Telcoin. However, 0x currently has two supported versions—v1 and v2—with notable differences that have led to incompatibilities within the protocol. According to the sponsor's guidance in the public Discord channel, the protocol will utilize [this contract](https://polygonscan.com/address/0xdef1c0ded9bec7f1a1670819833240f027b25eff) as the aggregator for 0x. This contract is the Exchange Proxy used in v1, whereas v2 relies on an entirely separate set of contracts. Actually, both v1 and v2 are not compatible with the current implementation.

### Root Cause

* v1 does not support FoT tokens as they are added in v2 ([resource1](https://0x.org/post/0x-v2-buy-sell-tax-swap-support), [resource2](https://0x.org/docs/developer-resources/buy-sell-tax-support#how-0x-solves-the-problem])). This makes the integration with the protocol impossible because FoT tokens are explicitly mentioned to be supported.
* v2 support FoT tokens but the interaction with the aggregator is different than v1. In v2 the allowance target is different than the contract which will make the swap and to which swapData is going to be send ([v2 token allowance resource1](https://0x.org/docs/0x-swap-api/guides/swap-tokens-with-0x-swap-api#2-set-a-token-allowance), [v2 token allowance resource2](https://0x.org/docs/0x-swap-api/advanced-topics/how-to-set-your-token-allowances)). This makes it impossible to integrate v2 with the current protocol implementation as the same address is used for allowance as well as executing the swap.

This makes the protocol incompatible with both v1 and v2.

### Internal pre-conditions

N/A

### External pre-conditions

Use of 0x.

### Attack Path

N/A

### Impact

0x cannot be used with the current implementation of the protocol.

### PoC

N/A

### Mitigation

Consider which version is going to be used. Have in mind that v1 is going to be deprecated soon, and there might be some future issue with the Swap API.
If sticking with v1, FoT wont be supported.
If choosing v2, the allowance target has to be explicitly passed to the defi swap function as it will be different than aggregator address.
