# `Swapper` Role will Cause Loss of Contract Funds in Fee-On-Transfer Token Scenarios

### Summary

A lack of adjustment for fee-on-transfer tokens will cause an ongoing loss of funds for the contract as the `swapper` role calls `_buyBack`, `feeDispersal`, and `_stablecoinSwap`, which do not account for fee deductions on transfers.

### Root Cause

1. [_buyBack: 224](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-telcoin/blob/b9c751b59e78a7123a636e31ecafc9147046f190/telcoin-audit/contracts/swap/AmirX.sol#L224) lacks logic to account for tokens that charge fees on transfers.
2. [_feeDispersal: 183](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-telcoin/blob/b9c751b59e78a7123a636e31ecafc9147046f190/telcoin-audit/contracts/swap/AmirX.sol#L183) omits validation for reduced token amounts from fees.
3. [_stablecoinSwap in StablecoinHandler.sol: 144](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-telcoin/blob/b9c751b59e78a7123a636e31ecafc9147046f190/telcoin-audit/contracts/stablecoin/StablecoinHandler.sol#L144) does not handle deductions on fee-on-transfer tokens.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. `Swapper` role needs to initiate a swap or buyback with a fee-on-transfer token.
2. The contract holds fee-on-transfer tokens that are processed through one of these functions.

### External pre-conditions

1. Fee-on-transfer token deducts a percentage from each transfer.
2. No adjustments in the code for receiving the reduced amounts.

### Attack Path

1. `Swapper` role initiates a buyback or swap with a fee-on-transfer token.
2. The transfer takes place, reducing the actual token amount by a fee.
3. The contract performs the operation with the deducted token amount, resulting in a silent loss of funds.

### Impact

The protocol suffers an ongoing loss of any tokens transferred with a fee. Depending on usage, this could accumulate into a significant amount over time, reducing available funds for swaps and buybacks.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Update `_buyBack`, `feeDispersal`, and `_stablecoinSwap` to adjust for reduced token balances after transfers. Add checks to verify the received amount and recalibrate the expected amount for each transaction
