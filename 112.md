# Potential loss of origin tokens when a smaller input value of Oamount compared to target amount.

0xlookman 

### Summary

According to the contest readme, `most inputs can be ignored in nearly any flow unless this would lead to a loss of funds`.

Lack of checks in `StablecoinHandler.sol::_verifyStablecoinSwap`, to ensure that the `ss.origin` token amount is equal or is the desired `ss.target` token amount can lead to loss of funds especially for non valid xyz tokens from the liquidity safe in cases where the `ss.oAmount` is very small compared to `ss.tAmount`.

### Root Cause

Lack check to see if the input `ss.oAmount` is the equivalent or the disired `ss.tAmount`.

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

- The input `ss.oAmount` in the `stableSwap ss` is equal to a very small amount greater than one.
- The `ss.tAmount` target amount is put to an amount which is very big 
- The contract will get the small `ss.oAmount` from the wallet.
- It will then mint the destination address a very big amount but will be less that the max supply. If the target is not a valid xyz, it will transfer the big `ss.tAmount` to the destination from the safe.

### Impact

Loss of funds from the `liquiditySafe` for non valid xyz token and minting of too much funds to the destination than the ones burned or received respectively.

### Mitigation

Add checks in  the `StablecoinHandler.sol::_verifyStablecoinSwap` to ensure that the `ss.oAmount` is equal or the desired amount compared to `ss.tAmount`.
