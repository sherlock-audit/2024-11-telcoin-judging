# Blacklisted user may avoid having their funds taken by frontrunning blacklist call and transferring the funds

### Summary

[Blacklist::addBlackList()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-telcoin/blob/main/telcoin-audit/contracts/util/abstract/Blacklist.sol#L77) transfers the funds from the blacklisted user to the `BLACKLISTER_ROLE`. The blacklisted user may frontrun this call and transfer the funds to another account, avoiding having their assets seized.

### Root Cause

In `Stablecoin:123`, funds are transferred from the blacklisted user to the `msg.sender`, which is the ` BLACKLISTER_ROLE`.

### Internal pre-conditions

None.

### External pre-conditions

None.

### Attack Path

1. To be blacklisted user transfers the funds to another account frontrunning the `Blacklist::addBlacklist()` call.
2. `BLACKLISTER_ROLE` calls `Blacklist::addBlacklist()`  on this user.

### Impact

The blacklisted user does not have its funds seized because it transferred them to another account before being blacklisted.

### PoC

```solidity
// Blacklist.sol
function addBlackList(
    address user
) public virtual onlyRole(BLACKLISTER_ROLE) {
    if (blacklisted(user)) revert AlreadyBlacklisted(user);
    _onceBlacklisted(user);
    // do this after so it doesnt trip blacklisted restirctions
    _setBlacklist(user, true);
    emit AddedBlacklist(user);
}

// Stablecoin.sol
function _onceBlacklisted(address user) internal override {
    _transfer(user, _msgSender(), balanceOf(user));
}
```

### Mitigation

The funds should be seized in some other way that can not be easily gamed.
