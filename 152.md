# The `defiSwap` reverts because the wallet does not transfer fee token to `AmirX` contract

### Summary

The `defiSwap` swaps tokens using the aggregator and pays fees to the referrer or `defiSafe`. However, it reverts because the wallet does not transfer the fee token to the `AmirX` contract. 

For example, if a user wants to swap `AAVE -> USDC` and the fee token is `USDC`, the wallet transfers `AAVE` to the aggregator, and the aggregator transfers `USDC` to the wallet. To pay the fee, the `AmirX` contract swaps the fee amount of `USDC` into `TELCOIN` using the aggregator. However, the `AmirX` contract does not receive the fee amount of `USDC` from the wallet. As a result, `defiSwap` reverts."

### Root Cause

In the `_defiSwap` function, it calls `wallet` contract with `defi.walletData` in L168.

```solidity
    function _defiSwap(address wallet, DefiSwap memory defi) internal {
L168:   (bool walletResult, ) = wallet.call{value: 0}(defi.walletData);
        require(walletResult, "AmirX: wallet transaction failed");

        _feeDispersal(defi);
    }
```

The `wallet` behaves like a Gnosis Safe and can only perform one transaction at a time, which the sponsor acknowledged during the contest. This means that `defi.walletData` contains only the transaction for swapping and does not include the transfer of fee tokens from the wallet to the `AmirX` contract. As a result, in the `defiSwap` function, the wallet does not transfer the fee tokens to the `AmirX` contract.

In the `_buyBack` function, it transfers the fee tokens from the `AmirX` contract to the aggregator to swap them into TELCOIN."

```solidity
        feeToken.forceApprove(aggregator, 0);
        feeToken.safeIncreaseAllowance(
            aggregator,
            feeToken.balanceOf(address(this))
        );

L247:   (bool ercSwap, ) = aggregator.call{value: 0}(swapData);
```

However, since there are no fee tokens received from the wallet in the `AmirX` contract, swapping them into TELCOIN reverts.

### Internal pre-conditions

User wants defi swapping.

### External pre-conditions

1. None

### Attack Path

None

### Impact

`defiSwap` reverts because the `AmirX` contract does not receive fee tokens from the wallet.

### PoC

None

### Mitigation

While defi swapping, add the code that enables the wallet to transfer fee tokens to `AmirX`.
