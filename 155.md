# ERC20 tokens may incur fee deductions on transfer which are not accounted for during swaps

### Summary

ERC20 tokens that impose fees on transfer can cause unexpected behavior during stablecoin swaps. In `_stablecoinSwap`, the `ERC20PermitUpgradeable.safeTransferFrom` function does not account for tokens with transfer fees, leading to potential discrepancies in token amounts received by the intended recipient, and possible operational inconsistencies.


### Root Cause

In `_stablecoinSwap` at the lines where `safeTransferFrom` is invoked for `ss.stablecoinFeeCurrency`, `ss.origin`, and `ss.target` tokens, there is no check or mechanism to account for transfer fees or deductions, which some tokens apply automatically.
```solidity
    function _stablecoinSwap(
        address wallet,
        StablecoinSwap memory ss
    ) internal {
        if (
            ss.stablecoinFeeCurrency != address(0) &&
            ss.stablecoinFeeSafe != address(0)
        )
            ERC20PermitUpgradeable(ss.stablecoinFeeCurrency).safeTransferFrom(
                wallet,
                ss.stablecoinFeeSafe,
                ss.feeAmount
            );

        // Handle the transfer or burning of the origin currency:
        // If the origin is a recognized stablecoin (XYZ), burn the specified amount from the wallet.
        if (isXYZ(ss.origin)) {
            Stablecoin(ss.origin).burnFrom(wallet, ss.oAmount);
        } else {
            ERC20PermitUpgradeable(ss.origin).safeTransferFrom(
                wallet,
                ss.liquiditySafe,
                ss.oAmount
            );
        }

        // Handle the minting or transferring of the target currency:
        // If the target is a recognized stablecoin (XYZ), mint the required amount to the destination address.
        if (isXYZ(ss.target)) {
            Stablecoin(ss.target).mintTo(ss.destination, ss.tAmount);
        } else {
            ERC20PermitUpgradeable(ss.target).safeTransferFrom(
                ss.liquiditySafe,
                ss.destination,
                ss.tAmount
            );
        }
    }

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. The `SWAPPER_ROLE` calls `stablecoinSwap` with an ERC20 token that has transfer fees set as `origin`, `target`, or `stablecoinFeeCurrency`.
2. The contract performs `safeTransferFrom` calls to move tokens, assuming the full transferred amount is received by the destination.
3. Due to the fee deduction on transfer, less than the specified amount arrives in the recipient account, causing discrepancies in expected token balances.


### Impact

The protocol and users experience inconsistencies and potential financial discrepancies due to unaccounted fees on transfer for certain ERC20 tokens. Users may lose a portion of their tokens during swaps, and the protocol may face issues with balance accounting, potentially impacting liquidity and operational reliability.


### PoC

### Mitigation

A potential mitigation is to check token balances before and after each transfer operation involving fee-on-transfer tokens to ensure correct handling and detect any discrepancies.
