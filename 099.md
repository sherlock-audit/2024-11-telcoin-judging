# Stablecoin Limit Verification Can Be Bypassed on `swap` and `defiToStablecoinSwap`

### Summary

Even though verification occurs in the swap function, it resets oAmount based on how many tokens are passed to the contract. If this amount is far different from what was initially verified it bypasses min and max limit checks. Both the `swap` function and `defiToStablecoinSwap` function are vulnerable.

### Root Cause

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-telcoin/blob/main/telcoin-audit/contracts/swap/AmirX.sol#L93 ss.oAmount is reset here, after verification checks

### Internal pre-conditions

N/A

### External pre-conditions

N/A

### Attack Path

1. Say origin amount is low for initial checks, then have wallet deposit a large amount of oAmount tokens to bypass max limit.

### Impact

Max mint limit can be bypassed and break the token's economics.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Run verification on stablecoin swap again after oAmount has been determined.
