# Fixed Swap Ratios in Defi to Stable Coin Swaps Can Cause Permanent User Loss and XYZ Stablecoins Depegging

### Summary

in defi to stable swaps, `ss.tamount` is fixed regardless of output amount of defi swap which is assigned to `ss.oamount`, this brings up two potential issues:
1- **Potential permanent loss for users:** in majority of `defi to stable coin` swaps, users receiving `tamount` by paying less `oamount` (profit) or receiving same `tamount` by paying more `oamount` **(permanent loss)**
2- **XYZ stablecoins loss peg:** Inconsistencies in the XYZ stablecoin reserves. Over time, this imbalance can prevent the XYZ tokens from maintaining their intended 1:1 peg, potentially leading to **depegging**.

### Root Cause

In the `defiToStablecoinSwap` or `swap(directional = true)` functions, each swap has two parts:

**1- Defi Swap:** Performed via aggregators like `0x` or `1inch`, where volatile tokens (e.g., ETH) are swapped for an intermediary token (e.g., USDC). The output amount here `(ss.oAmount)` can vary based on market conditions and prior transactions. https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-telcoin/blob/main/telcoin-audit/contracts/swap/AmirX.sol#L123
**2- Stablecoin Swap:** Swaps output of first swap (`ss.oAmount` of `ss.origin`) for a fixed `ss.tAmount` of `ss.target` (an XYZ token in our example) https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-telcoin/blob/main/telcoin-audit/contracts/swap/AmirX.sol#L122-L127

Because the second swap uses a fixed ratio (`tAmount` for `oAmount`), any fluctuation in the first swap can result in users either facing permanent loss (e.g. paying more USDC for the same amount of XYZ) or gaining unintended benefits (paying less USDC for more XYZ). **This inconsistency can also cause the reserves of the XYZ token to become imbalanced and not maintain the intended 1:1 peg, potentially leading to depegging.**

**Scenario:**
- Alice decides to swap 1 ETH (priced at 2700$) for 2700 XYZ token
- Alice initiates the swap through Telecoin platform, agreeing to the ratios and setting 5% as the slippage tolerance
- Since trump won and Kamala lost, ETH price goes up by 4% hence first part of swap results in 2810$ USDC and `ss.oamount` is set to `2810e6`: https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-telcoin/blob/main/telcoin-audit/contracts/swap/AmirX.sol#L122-L125
- Now, second part of the swap is executed in `_stablecoinSwap` function, swapping `2810e6` of ` ss.origin` for `2700e18` of `ss.target`: https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-telcoin/blob/main/telcoin-audit/contracts/stablecoin/StablecoinHandler.sol#L160-L180

In this scenario which is very likely to happen, Alice made a permanent loss on this trade and XYZ reserves made a deviation from being 1:1, in this scenario each XYZ stable coin was traded 1.04$.

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

- The first coin in the `defi to stable coin swap` being and active and volatile token like ETH

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

In the `defiToStablecoinSwap` function, the two-part swap process can lead to the:
1- Permanent loss for users, i.e paying more USDC for receiving less XYZ stablecoin
2- `depegging` of the `XYZ` tokens due to exchange rate fluctuations in the first swap.

The impact of this issue is higher if the first token in the `defi to stable` swap path is a token with a low marketcap, for example, if user decided to swap a volatile meme coin for an XYZ stable coin, the impact of this could be way higher (depends on slippage tolerance also)
