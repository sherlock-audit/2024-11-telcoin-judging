# Lack of Pause and Unpause Mechanism to protect contract from Hacks

### Summary

The `Lack of Pause and Unpause` Mechanism vulnerability in a smart contract refers to the absence of an `emergency stop function that allows authorized entities to temporarily halt contract operations` in response to suspicious activity, security breaches, or unexpected failures. Without this mechanism, the contract cannot be paused to prevent further transactions during a security incident, leaving it vulnerable to exploits that could result in significant asset losses or compromise of user data. This is especially critical in decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms, where attacks can drain liquidity pools or manipulate token values.

### Root Cause

In the whole contracts no pause mechanism

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

Financial Losses: Loss of funds from the contract, affecting users and potentially damaging the reputation of the platform.

### PoC

1. An attacker discovers a vulnerability in the contract, such as a reentrancy issue or an unchecked arithmetic operation.
2. They begin exploiting this vulnerability, executing rapid, repetitive transactions that drain assets from the contract.
3. Since the contract lacks a pause function, the platform's operators are unable to halt the contract operations to prevent further damage.
4. The exploitation continues until the contract is emptied of funds or otherwise corrupted.
In this case, the inability to halt the contract contributes directly to the impact of the attack, highlighting the need for an emergency pause/unpause feature.

### Mitigation

Add a pause and unpause mechanism to prevent draining protocols incase of emergency
