# Malicious Inputs to `defiSwap` Can Lead to Unexpected Behavior or Exploitation



**Title:** Malicious Inputs to `defiSwap` Can Lead to Unexpected Behavior or Exploitation

---

**Summary**

The missing comprehensive validation in the `_verifyDefiSwap` function in `AmirX.sol` will cause potential loss of funds or disruption of contract operations as attackers will exploit the lack of validation to execute unintended actions.

---

**Root Cause**

In [`AmirX.sol`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-telcoin/blob/main/telcoin-audit/contracts/swap/AmirX.sol#L264-L279), at **lines 264-279**, the `_verifyDefiSwap` function performs minimal validation:

```solidity
// Lines 264-279
function _verifyDefiSwap(address wallet, DefiSwap memory defi) internal pure {
    if (wallet == address(0)) revert ZeroValueInput("WALLET");
    // validate pathway
    if (defi.feeToken != TELCOIN && address(defi.feeToken) != address(0)) {
        if (defi.aggregator == address(0) || defi.swapData.length == 0)
            revert ZeroValueInput("BUYBACK");
    }
    // determines if there is a referrer increase
    if (defi.referrer != address(0)) {
        if (address(defi.plugin) == address(0))
            revert ZeroValueInput("PLUGIN");
    }
}
```

The function does not check whether the provided addresses (e.g., `defi.aggregator`, `defi.plugin`) are trusted or whether the data provided in `defi.swapData` and `defi.walletData` is safe.

---

**Internal Pre-conditions**

1. **Attacker provides malicious `DefiSwap` parameters**: The attacker crafts parameters that can cause unintended behavior.
2. **Contract lacks comprehensive validation**: The contract does not verify that addresses are trusted or that data conforms to expected formats.

---

**Attack Path**

1. **Attacker crafts `DefiSwap` with malicious data**: For example, using a malicious `aggregator` address that redirects funds.
2. **Attacker calls `defiSwap` with these parameters**: The contract accepts and processes the inputs.
3. **Contract executes unintended actions**: Funds may be sent to unauthorized addresses, or the contract may enter an invalid state.

---

**Impact**

The contract and its users may suffer **loss of funds, unauthorized state changes, or denial of service**. The attacker can redirect funds or disrupt contract functionality.

---

**Proof of Concept (PoC)**

Attacker uses an untrusted `aggregator` address:

```solidity
DefiSwap memory maliciousDefi = DefiSwap({
    defiSafe: attackerAddress,
    aggregator: attackerAggregatorAddress, // Malicious aggregator
    plugin: ...,
    feeToken: ...,
    referrer: ...,
    referralFee: ...,
    walletData: ...,
    swapData: ... // Crafted to misdirect funds
});

// Attacker calls defiSwap with malicious parameters
amirX.defiSwap(attackerWallet, maliciousDefi);
```

---

**Mitigation**

Implement comprehensive input validation in the `_verifyDefiSwap` function to ensure that all addresses and data are trusted and safe:

```solidity
function _verifyDefiSwap(address wallet, DefiSwap memory defi) internal view {
    require(wallet != address(0), "AmirX: invalid wallet");

    // Ensure feeToken is acceptable
    require(isSupportedToken(defi.feeToken), "AmirX: unsupported fee token");

    // Verify that aggregator is trusted
    require(isTrustedAggregator(defi.aggregator), "AmirX: untrusted aggregator");

    // Validate plugin if referrer is set
    if (defi.referrer != address(0)) {
        require(isTrustedPlugin(defi.plugin), "AmirX: untrusted plugin");
    }

    // Additional validation on swapData and walletData
    require(validateSwapData(defi.swapData), "AmirX: invalid swap data");
    require(validateWalletData(defi.walletData), "AmirX: invalid wallet data");
}
```

Implement helper functions like `isSupportedToken`, `isTrustedAggregator`, `isTrustedPlugin`, `validateSwapData`, and `validateWalletData` to perform thorough checks.

### Conclusion

The medium severity issues identified in the Telcoin smart contracts pose significant risks that could lead to loss of funds or disruption of contract operations. It is crucial to address these vulnerabilities promptly to enhance the security and reliability of the system.

**Recommended Actions:**

1. **Revise Approval Mechanisms**: Avoid unsafe approval patterns to mitigate allowance race conditions.
2. **Ensure Transfer Success**: Add success checks when transferring tokens to prevent fund lock-up.
3. **Review Storage Slot Management**: Use unique storage slots in upgradeable contracts to prevent collisions.
4. **Enhance Input Validation**: Strengthen the validation logic for functions handling external inputs to prevent malicious exploitation.

**Final Note:**

Implementing these mitigations will significantly improve the security posture of the Telcoin smart contracts. It is highly recommended to engage with professional security auditors for a comprehensive assessment and to ensure all vulnerabilities are addressed effectively.
