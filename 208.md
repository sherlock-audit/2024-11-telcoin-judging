# Unnecessary Restrictions within `swap` Function when `ss.origin == ss.target`

### Summary

In the `StablecoinHandler.sol` contract, the `stablecoinSwap()` function initiates a stablecoin swap by calling the internal `_stablecoinSwap()` function. The purpose of `_stablecoinSwap()` is to transfer or mint/burn stablecoins between two different tokens. However, there’s a restriction in `_stablecoinSwap()` that affects cases where the origin token (`ss.origin`) and target token (`ss.target`) are the same.

In specific scenarios, users might need to perform a transfer involving the same token (i.e., `ss.origin == ss.target`). For instance, a wallet owner may want to transfer tokens they control but don’t have immediate access to. However, the unnecessary restriction in [stablecoinSwap](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-telcoin/blob/main/telcoin-audit/contracts/stablecoin/StablecoinHandler.sol#L144-L181) makes it impossible to handle cases where both tokens are the same, even though no changes to total supply are required.

This restriction unnecessarily limits the functionality of the protocol, as transfers within the same token should be allowed under certain conditions.

This is a specific problem of the protocol itself (limitation of the logic).


### Root Cause

The root cause of this bug lies in the restrictive checks within `_stablecoinSwap()` that treat scenarios where `ss.origin == ss.target` as invalid. The contract assumes that any swap must involve two different tokens, imposing mint and burn checks even when the total supply of the token remains unchanged.

The key portion of the code in `_stablecoinSwap()` that enforces this restriction is as follows:

```solidity
// Handle the transfer or burning of the origin currency:
// If the origin is a recognized stablecoin (XYZ), burn the specified amount from the wallet.
if (isXYZ(ss.origin)) {
    Stablecoin(ss.origin).burnFrom(wallet, ss.oAmount);
} else {
    ERC20PermitUpgradeable(ss.origin).safeTransferFrom(
        wallet,
        ss.liquiditySafe,
        ss.oAmount
    );
}

// Handle the minting or transferring of the target currency:
// If the target is a recognized stablecoin (XYZ), mint the required amount to the destination address.
if (isXYZ(ss.target)) {
    Stablecoin(ss.target).mintTo(ss.destination, ss.tAmount);
} else {
    ERC20PermitUpgradeable(ss.target).safeTransferFrom(
        ss.liquiditySafe,
        ss.destination,
        ss.tAmount
    );
}
```

These mint and burn operations should not apply if the origin and target tokens are the same, as they result in unnecessary checks on the token's total supply.


### Internal pre-conditions

- The `stablecoinSwap()` function is called with `ss.origin == ss.target`.
- The parameters for the `StablecoinSwap` struct (`ss`) are correctly populated.
- The `_stablecoinSwap()` function does not account for cases where `ss.origin` and `ss.target` are the same, leading to an unnecessary restriction. This is a specific problem of the protocol itself (limitation of the logic)


### External pre-conditions

- A user or wallet owner wishes to execute a swap or transfer of the same stablecoin, where `ss.origin == ss.target`.
- The user expects that this transfer will proceed without minting or burning, as the token supply does not change.


### Attack Path

1. A user with the appropriate permissions calls `stablecoinSwap()` with `ss.origin` equal to `ss.target`.
2. The function calls `_stablecoinSwap()`, triggering unnecessary burn/mint checks, even though no change in token supply is needed.
3. This results in an error or rejection of the swap due to these additional checks, even though the swap should logically be valid as a transfer between the same token.


### Impact

The main impact of this bug is that it restricts legitimate use cases where the same token is used for both origin and target. This can be a serious limitation for users who may want to transfer or manage liquidity in the same token but cannot do so due to the restriction.

This is a specific problem of the protocol itself (limitation of the logic).

### PoC

```solidity
StablecoinSwap memory ss = StablecoinSwap({
    liquiditySafe: 0x...,
    destination: 0xRecipient,
    origin: 0xTokenAddress,  // Same token as target
    oAmount: 1000,
    target: 0xTokenAddress,  // Same token as origin
    tAmount: 1000,
    stablecoinFeeCurrency: 0xTokenAddress,
    stablecoinFeeSafe: 0xFeeSafeAddress,
    feeAmount: 10
});
```

If `ss.origin == ss.target` in the example above, the current restrictions would reject the swap or transfer, preventing the intended use of the same token on both ends. This undermines the protocol's usability and could reduce the adoption of the protocol by users who need this functionality.

### Mitigation

To address this bug, adjust `_stablecoinSwap()` to allow the same token for `ss.origin` and `ss.target` in specific scenarios. This can be done by adding a condition that skips the minting and burning operations if `ss.origin == ss.target`.

### Proposed Code Fix

```solidity
function _stablecoinSwap(
    address wallet,
    StablecoinSwap memory ss
) internal {
    if (ss.stablecoinFeeCurrency != address(0) && ss.stablecoinFeeSafe != address(0)) {
        ERC20PermitUpgradeable(ss.stablecoinFeeCurrency).safeTransferFrom(
            wallet,
            ss.stablecoinFeeSafe,
            ss.feeAmount
        );
    }

    // If the origin and target are the same, perform a simple transfer without mint/burn.
    if (ss.origin == ss.target) {
        ERC20PermitUpgradeable(ss.origin).safeTransferFrom(
            wallet,
            ss.destination,
            ss.oAmount
        );
        return;
    }

    // Handle the transfer or burning of the origin currency.
    if (isXYZ(ss.origin)) {
        Stablecoin(ss.origin).burnFrom(wallet, ss.oAmount);
    } else {
        ERC20PermitUpgradeable(ss.origin).safeTransferFrom(
            wallet,
            ss.liquiditySafe,
            ss.oAmount
        );
    }

    // Handle the minting or transferring of the target currency.
    if (isXYZ(ss.target)) {
        Stablecoin(ss.target).mintTo(ss.destination, ss.tAmount);
    } else {
        ERC20PermitUpgradeable(ss.target).safeTransferFrom(
            ss.liquiditySafe,
            ss.destination,
            ss.tAmount
        );
    }
}
```
