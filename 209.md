# In `AmirX.sol` the `swap` function will lead to exexpected behaviour when directional = false due to wrong implementation

### Summary

In the [swap function](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-telcoin/blob/main/telcoin-audit/contracts/swap/AmirX.sol#L73) is used for performing and handling both `stableCoin` swaps and `defiSwaps`. but the function is implemented like, the validations for both the swaps are happening [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-telcoin/blob/main/telcoin-audit/contracts/swap/AmirX.sol#L80C4-L82C1) in starting of the function. the issue here is that when the directional flag is set to false- [not directional](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-telcoin/blob/main/telcoin-audit/contracts/swap/AmirX.sol#L96) the validations are not performed for the swaps as can be seen [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-telcoin/blob/main/telcoin-audit/contracts/swap/AmirX.sol#L96C1-L102C6) due to this the function will try to execute swaps without the modifier for the `stableCoinSwap` and the other validations which are necassary for executing these swaps. This can cause or lead unexpected behaviour in the function because without the input validations the function might try to execute with 0 values altogether. That being said:
As we can see that the the function is permissioned to the SWAPPER_ROLE only. even then there are some inputs in the struct that are passed by the users itself. For Example - the `ss.origin` token, i.e is swapIn token, `target` token i.e the swapOut token along with the amounts.

### Root Cause

Incorrect implementation in the `swap` function

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

when the direction flag is set to 
false

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

The `swap` function will cause problems in case of directional = false due to no input validation at all.

```solidity
        } else {
            // if stablecoin swap
            _stablecoinSwap(wallet, ss);
            // if only stablecoin swap
            if (defi.walletData.length != 0) _defiSwap(wallet, defi);
        }
    }
```


### Mitigation

Add the required validations for both the swaps before the execution.

```solidity
        } else {
            // if stablecoin swap
      +    _verifyStablecoinSwap(wallet, ss);
            _stablecoinSwap(wallet, ss);
            // if only stablecoin swap
      +     _verifyDefiSwap(wallet, defi);
            if (defi.walletData.length != 0) _defiSwap(wallet, defi);
        }
    }
 

```
