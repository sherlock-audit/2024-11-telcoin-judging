# Fixed Target Amount in Sequential DeFi-Stablecoin Swaps Leads to Value Loss and Unfair Protocol Gains

### Summary

Protocol will unfairly gain excess value from favorable price movements in defi-to-stablecoin swaps as it controls the wallet that receives the DeFi swap proceeds while only committing to deliver a fixed target amount to the user.


### Root Cause

The choice to use a fixed target amount (tAmount) in AmirX.sol in swap and defiToStablecoinSwap at https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-telcoin/blob/main/telcoin-audit/contracts/swap/AmirX.sol#L127 is a mistake as it prevents users from capturing upside in favorable market movements during the sequential swap process.

```solidity
function defiToStablecoinSwap(
    address wallet,
    StablecoinSwap memory ss,
    DefiSwap memory defi
) external payable onlyRole(SWAPPER_ROLE) whenNotPaused {
    _verifyDefiSwap(wallet, defi);
    _verifyStablecoinSwap(wallet, ss);

    uint256 iBalance = ERC20(ss.origin).balanceOf(wallet);
    _defiSwap(wallet, defi);
    uint256 fBalance = ERC20(ss.origin).balanceOf(wallet);
    ss.oAmount = fBalance - iBalance;
    _stablecoinSwap(wallet, ss); // user receives tAmount originally specified
}
```

## Contrast with Standard DEX Swaps

Standard DEX swaps typically implement:
```solidity
struct SwapParams {
    uint256 amountIn;
    uint256 minAmountOut;  // Floor protection, not ceiling
    // ...
}
```
Key issues:

- Standard swaps set minimum output but no maximum
- Users capture all upside from favorable price movements
- In AmirX, similarly, user anyways has paid the fee and should not be limited to target amount

### Attack Path

Initial Setup:
1 ETH = $3,000
Expected: 1 ETH → 3,000 USDC → 3,000 USDe


When ETH price increases to $3,300:
What Should Happen:
1 ETH → 3,300 USDC → ~3,000 USDe

What Actually Happens:
1 ETH → 3,300 USDC → only 3,000 USDe (fixed amount)
Protocol keeps: ~300 USDC excess


The issue is:
1. Higher ETH price gets more USDC in first swap
2. But fixed `tAmount` in contract means user still only gets 3,000 USDe
3. Protocol keeps the extra USDC (~300) from favorable ETH price
4. User loses out on ~300 USDe they should have received

This is unfair because users don't benefit from favorable ETH price movements, while the protocol captures the excess value.
