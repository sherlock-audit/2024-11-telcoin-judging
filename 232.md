# Blacklisted addresses can still call/interact with Telcoin core/swap functions

### Summary

`Stablecoin.sol` enforeces blacklist functionality by restricting the `_update()` for users who have been added to blacklist hence any transaction to and from their address will be restricted, but blacklisted users can still make calls to swap functions such as `stablecoinSwap()` with the help of delegate calls through contracts that have been funded with eXYZ tokens or other DeFi tokens. The blacklisted wallets will be able to by pass the `onlyRole(SWAPPER_ROLE)` since the modifer uses `msg.sender`(which would be the blacklisted address and not the external delegate contract) to check if addresses calling these functions are allowed to, which blacklisted addresses still have.https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-telcoin/blob/b9c751b59e78a7123a636e31ecafc9147046f190/telcoin-audit/contracts/stablecoin/StablecoinHandler.sol#L144-L181

### Root Cause

- Lack of checks for calls made by blacklisted addresses in each swap function.

### Internal pre-conditions
