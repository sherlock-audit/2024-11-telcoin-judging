# BLACKLISTER_ROLE can withdraw funds which are meant to be rescued by SUPPORT_ROLE

### Summary

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-telcoin/blob/b9c751b59e78a7123a636e31ecafc9147046f190/telcoin-audit/contracts/util/abstract/Blacklist.sol#L77-L85

The `Blacklist::addBlackList()` function doesn't check if the provided user is the Stablecoin contract which will cause to bypass SUPPORT_ROLE and withdraw big portion of the accidentally sent tokens to the Stablecoin contract.

### Root Cause

If the `BLACKLISTER_ROLE` provides the Stablecoin's contract address as a function parameter accidentally (it is possible and a valid case according to the project's README) or if it is malicious, the Stablecoin native tokens which are accidentally sent to the Stablecoin contract will be withdrawn to the `BLACKLISTER_ROLE` address.

```solidity
Blacklist.sol

function addBlackList(
    address user
) public virtual onlyRole(BLACKLISTER_ROLE) {
    if (blacklisted(user)) revert AlreadyBlacklisted(user);
    _onceBlacklisted(user);
    // do this after so it doesnt trip blacklisted restirctions
    _setBlacklist(user, true);
    emit AddedBlacklist(user);
}
```

```solidity
Stablecoin.sol

function _onceBlacklisted(address user) internal override {
    _transfer(user, _msgSender(), balanceOf(user));
}
```

If the `SUPPORT_ROLE` tries to rescue the funds, the `Stablecoin::erc20Rescue()` function will revert, because the address is blacklisted. Even the `BLACKLISTER_ROLE` calls `removeBlackList()` to unblacklist the user, the tokens will be already sent.

The `BLACKLISTER_ROLE` uses the functionality which is meant to be used from `SUPPORT_ROLE`.

### Internal pre-conditions

A user/s needs to accidentally sent Stablecoin tokens to the Stablecoin contract. It is very likely to happen and there are many real world examples.
Big percentage of the accidentally sent tokens are the contract's own tokens. Some examples - [OMG](https://etherscan.io/address/0xd26114cd6ee289accf82350c8d8487fedb8a0c07), WETH ([Example1](https://etherscan.io/tx/0x96a7155b44b77c173e7c534ae1ceca536ba2ce534012ff844cf8c1737bc54921), [Example2](https://etherscan.io/tx/0x049cd0e7114d1559d6fa854166a0300efc14df01fcf26a4b1ff69771f8da897f)), etc.

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. A user accidentally sends 100 Stablecoin tokens to the Stablecoin contract
2. The MINTER_ROLE calls addBlackList() function with Stablecoin's address as a parameter which transfers all the Stablecoin tokens of the Stablecoin contract to his address
3. SUPPORT_ROLE sees there are tokens sent to the contract and tries to transfer them back to the user
4. The erc20Rescue() function reverts, because the Stablecoin contract's address is blacklisted

### Impact

The BLACKLISTER_ROLE uses SUPPORT_ROLE's functionality and it is possible the user, who accidentally sent tokens to the Stablecoin contract, doesn't get his tokens if the BLACKLISTER_ROLE is a smart contract and doesn't have a functionality to send back tokens.

### PoC

Add the following test case in `Stablecoin.test.ts`

```typescript
describe.only("Call addBlackList with Stablecoin's address", () => {
    it("blacklist", async () => {
        const users = await ethers.getSigners();
        let randomUser = users[2];
        let blacklister = users[3];
        let support = users[3];

        await stablecoin.grantRole(MINTER_ROLE, deployer);
        await stablecoin.grantRole(BLACKLISTER_ROLE, blacklister);
        await stablecoin.grantRole(SUPPORT_ROLE, support);

        // A random user has 100 Stablecoin tokens
        await stablecoin.mintTo(randomUser, 100);

        // The user accidentally sends the tokens to the contract
        await stablecoin.connect(randomUser).transfer(stablecoin, 100);

        // The minter calls addBlackList with Stablecoin's address as a user which transfers all the Stablecoin tokens to his address
        await stablecoin.connect(blacklister).addBlackList(stablecoin);

        // Support sees the tokens are sent to the contract and tries to transfer them back to the user
        await expect(stablecoin.connect(support).erc20Rescue(stablecoin, randomUser, 100)).to.be.reverted;

        expect(await stablecoin.balanceOf(blacklister)).to.equal(100);
        expect(await stablecoin.balanceOf(randomUser)).to.equal(0);
        expect(await stablecoin.balanceOf(stablecoin)).to.equal(0);
    });
});
```

### Mitigation

Check if the `user` in `_onceBlacklisted` is the Stablecoin contract.

```diff
function _onceBlacklisted(address user) internal override {
+    require(user != address(this), "user can't be Stablecoin contract");
    _transfer(user, _msgSender(), balanceOf(user));
}
```
