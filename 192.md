# Users will lose tokens when there is a swap fee.

### Summary

Before calling the swap function, the swapper will have to transfer fee tokens to `AmirX.sol` so that it can be swapped to telcoin if not already telcoin:

```solidity
    function _buyBack(
        ERC20 feeToken,
        address aggregator,
        address safe,
        bytes memory swapData
    ) internal {
        if (address(feeToken) == address(0)) return;
        if (address(feeToken) == POL) {
            (bool polSwap, ) = aggregator.call{value: msg.value}(swapData);
            require(polSwap, "AmirX: POL swap transaction failed");

            if (address(this).balance > 0) {
                (bool success, ) = safe.call{value: address(this).balance}("");
                require(success, "AmirX: POL send transaction failed");
            }
        } else {
            // zero out approval
            feeToken.forceApprove(aggregator, 0);
            feeToken.safeIncreaseAllowance(
                aggregator,
                feeToken.balanceOf(address(this))
            );

@>            (bool ercSwap, ) = aggregator.call{value: 0}(swapData);
            require(ercSwap, "AmirX: token swap transaction failed");

            uint256 remainder = feeToken.balanceOf(address(this));
            if (remainder > 0) feeToken.safeTransfer(safe, remainder);
        }
    }
```

But if someone frontruns the swap call after the Swapper has sent the tokens, they can take all of these tokens out very easily. This is not the case when the fee token is POL as it can be sent in the same transaction. But for the other tokens, the theft is possible.



### Root Cause

The AmirX contract expects that the tokens are already in the contracts. So either user must send them or the Swapper before the swap.
