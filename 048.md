# Swap the same fee-on-transfer token leads to loss of liquiditySafe funds

### Summary

First, note that the current implementation differs from the implementation on the past audit in that it allows direct swaps between two ERC20 tokens.
```solidity
function _stablecoinSwap(
        address wallet,
        StablecoinSwap memory ss
    ) internal {
        if (
            ss.stablecoinFeeCurrency != address(0) &&
            ss.stablecoinFeeSafe != address(0)
        )
            ERC20PermitUpgradeable(ss.stablecoinFeeCurrency).safeTransferFrom(
                wallet,
                ss.stablecoinFeeSafe,
                ss.feeAmount
            );

        // Handle the transfer or burning of the origin currency:
        // If the origin is a recognized stablecoin (XYZ), burn the specified amount from the wallet.
        if (isXYZ(ss.origin)) {
            Stablecoin(ss.origin).burnFrom(wallet, ss.oAmount);
        } else {
            ERC20PermitUpgradeable(ss.origin).safeTransferFrom(
                wallet,
                ss.liquiditySafe,
                ss.oAmount
            );
        }

        // Handle the minting or transferring of the target currency:
        // If the target is a recognized stablecoin (XYZ), mint the required amount to the destination address.
        if (isXYZ(ss.target)) {
            Stablecoin(ss.target).mintTo(ss.destination, ss.tAmount);
        } else {
            ERC20PermitUpgradeable(ss.target).safeTransferFrom(
                ss.liquiditySafe,
                ss.destination,
                ss.tAmount
            );
        }
    }
```

Second, note that there is no validation that origin token != target token.

It is logical to assume that in the case origin = target the token conversion rate will be 1:1.That is, oAmount = tAmount.

Now consider the case where origin = target = fee-on-transfer token. Under the terms of the Readme fee-on-transfer tokens in scope

In case of ERC20 / ERC20 [`stablecoinSwap`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-telcoin/blob/main/telcoin-audit/contracts/stablecoin/StablecoinHandler.sol#L144) tokens go this route in one transaction.
Wallet ->(oAmount) liquidity safe ->(tAmount) destination. (tAmount = oAmount)

Note that because there are actually two transfers - the transfer fee is paid twice.

Thus, half of the commission is paid at the expense of the user, and the other half at the expense of liquiditySafe. Let's consider the changes of balances as a result of such swap.

Wallet loses as much as it has to lose - oAmount. 

The liquiditySafe account receives the amount oAmount - fee, but the transfer is sent not on oAmount - fee, but on tAmount, which is equal to oAmount. 

Destination receives tAmount - fee.


### Root Cause

In my opinion the root goat here is the case where a swap between two identical ERC20 tokens is allowed, but there is no verification that liquiditySafe has received enough tokens to cover the liquidity of the swap.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. The user must cause a swap between two identical fee-on-transfer tokens. The protocol does not have sufficient validation for this case.

2. The token exchange rate for such a swap should be 1:1. As far as I understood from the dialogue with the protocol team, it is so.

### External pre-conditions

The protocol must support fee-on-transfer stablecoin. 
Although there are no such stablecoins now, USDT and USDC can be upgraded to this functionality.  And their behaviour in scope, as well as fee-on-transfer tokens themselves.

In one of the [valid issues](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-telcoin-platform-audit-update-judging/issues/26) in a past audit of this protocol, there was a discussion about ‘Future issues’. I think it applies in this case as well. 

### Attack Path

1. Wallet Swap fee-on-transfer stablecoin for the same stablecoin. For example, assume oAmoun = 100. And fee = 10. And liquiditySafe initial balance = 50.
2. stablecoinSwap transfer oAmount to liquiditySafe. But, liquiditySafe receive only 90 due to fee.
3. Then liquiditySafe transfer tAmount = 100 to destination. Destination receive just 90, but liquiditySafe loose 10.

Initial Balances: wallet = 100, liquiditySafe = 50, Destination = 0
Balances at the end: wallet = 0, liquiditySafe = 40, Destination = 90.

### Impact

The protocol loses funds from liquiditySafe with these swaps. The loss of user funds due to fee on transfer is not an issue in itself, but in this case liquiditySafe loses funds.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

1. Check that origin token != destination token
