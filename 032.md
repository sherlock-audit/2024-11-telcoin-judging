# Potential Supply Limit Bypass in AmirX Swap Function

### Summary

Incorrect placement of supply limit verification will cause a min supply limit bypass for stablecoin holders as users performing legitimate combined DeFi and stablecoin operations can unintentionally burn tokens beyond the min allowed supply in both swap() and defiToStablecoinSwap() functions.


### Root Cause

In two locations:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-telcoin/blob/main/telcoin-audit/contracts/swap/AmirX.sol#L80 - The swap() function verifies supply limits before DeFi operations
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-telcoin/blob/main/telcoin-audit/contracts/swap/AmirX.sol#L119 - The defiToStablecoinSwap() function has the same issue

In both cases, supply limit verification occurs before the DeFi swap, but the amount used for burning is dynamically updated after the verification, potentially violating the min limit which is on the changed ss.oAmount
```solidity
if (isXYZ(ss.origin)) {
    if (Stablecoin(ss.origin).totalSupply() - ss.oAmount < getMinLimit(ss.origin))
        revert InvalidMintBurnBoundry(ss.origin, ss.oAmount);
}
```

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

- User calls swap() with directional = true or defiToStablecoinSwap() involving XYZ stablecoin
- Supply verification passes with initial ss.oAmount
- DeFi swap results in stablecoin balance
- Code updates ss.oAmount to new balance which might be higher than the initial ss.oAmount
- Final mint go below min limit, which would otherwise be prevented using the check in _verifyStablecoinSwap


### Impact

The stablecoin protocol's core supply limit invariant is violated during normal operations. Users can unintentionally mint tokens beyond the maximum supply limit, which could affect the stablecoin's stability and peg maintenance mechanisms.
