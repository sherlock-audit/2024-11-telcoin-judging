# Stablecoin minimum limits can be bypassed

### Summary

Whenever a stablecoin swap occurs it is validated that the total supply of the token, which is getting burned, is not less than a minimum value. The issue is that this validation can be bypassed, whenever a stabelcoin swap occurs through AmirX.

### Root Cause

In the `swap` and `defiToStablecoinSwap` functions of AmirX the `_verifyStablecoinSwap` is called at the beginning of the function, with the `ss.oAmount` supplied by the swapper. However, `ss.oAmount` is later changed:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-telcoin/blob/b9c751b59e78a7123a636e31ecafc9147046f190/telcoin-audit/contracts/swap/AmirX.sol#L93
```solidity
if (fBalance - iBalance != 0) ss.oAmount = fBalance - iBalance;
```

Thus, if the new value is more than the initial, the total supply of the origin stablecoin may be less than the `getMinLimit(ss.origin)`.

### External pre-conditions

### Attack Path

1. The minimum total supply of the origin token is 1e18, and the current total supply is 2e18
2. A swapper calls `swap`, setting the `ss.oAmount` to 0.5e18, passing the validation in `_verifyStablecoinSwap`
3. However, the `ss.oAmount` increases to 1.1e18, causing the total supply of the origin token to be less than the minimum limit

### Impact

A stabelcoin's total supply goes below the minimum limit, which should never happen.

### Mitigation

Call `_verifyStablecoinSwap` after `ss.oAmount` has been updated.
