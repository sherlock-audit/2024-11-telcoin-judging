# The defiToStablecoinSwap function and the swap function don't have the same implementation

### Summary

When you perform a swap with the directional set to true and with a distination for the StablecoinSwat not set to address(0) then the protocol peform a defiSwap and then a stableCoinSwap.

if the target token of the defi swap is the same that the origin token then the safety check will change the origin amount and the function perform the stablecoin swap only with the amount that the user receive from the defi swap otherwise if the tokens are different then the function will perform the two swaps independently.  

However if you do the same with the defiToStablecoinSwap function the result maybe different because there is no check and if the user receive no origin token then the protocol will perform a stablecoin swap without any origin amount.

### Root Cause

there is a missing check in the defiToStablecoinSwap(L-125) function .

### Internal pre-conditions

the swapper call the defiToStablecoinSwap function and the user receive no token.

### External pre-conditions

none

### Attack Path

1. The user want to make a defi swap and a stableCoin swap the two swap have absolutely nothing in common he call defiToStablecoinSwap.


### Impact

The protocol will perform the stablecoin swap with no origin amount.

### PoC

none

### Mitigation

I think the protocol should add the safety check in defiToStablecoinSwap in order that the function behave like intended.

```solidity 
  uint256 fBalance = ERC20(ss.origin).balanceOf(wallet);
       if (fBalance - iBalance != 0)   ss.oAmount = fBalance - iBalance;
```
