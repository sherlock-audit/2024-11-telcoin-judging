# Blacklisted Addresses Can Access DeFi Swap and Receive Referral Fees, Bypassing Blacklist Restrictions

### Summary

The `AmirX` contract does not enforce blacklist restrictions in its DeFi swap functions, allowing blacklisted addresses to initiate swaps and even receive referral fees. This lack of validation undermines blacklist controls, allowing prohibited users to interact with the protocol and earn rewards.

Based on result of previous audit Blacklist address cannot perform operations with Stablecoin but here they can access defiSwap & receive referral fee from the system.

### Root Cause

In [AmirX.defiSwap: 156](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-telcoin/blob/b9c751b59e78a7123a636e31ecafc9147046f190/telcoin-audit/contracts/swap/AmirX.sol#L156) &  [AmirX._feeDispersal: 183](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-telcoin/blob/b9c751b59e78a7123a636e31ecafc9147046f190/telcoin-audit/contracts/swap/AmirX.sol#L183), the swap function lack checks to verify that the wallet or referrer addresses are not blacklisted. As a result, blacklisted addresses can still perform swaps and earn referral fees, bypassing blacklist enforcement applied in stablecoin-related operations.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. A user address is added to the blacklist using `addBlackList` in the Blacklist contract.
2. The blacklisted address initiates a DeFi swap or is set as a referrer within one of the AmirX contract.

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. A blacklisted user can interact with DeFi swap function or can be a referrer for other users.
2. `SWAPPER_ROLE` executes the swap function, invoking `_defiSwap` or `_feeDispersal` without verifying the blacklist status of the wallet or referrer.
3. The swap completes successfully, allowing the blacklisted address to interact with AmirX contract and can receive referral rewards from the system.

### Impact

Blacklisted users can bypass protocol restrictions, initiating DeFi swap operations and receiving referral fees. This undermines compliance measures, allowing blacklisted or potentially sanctioned entities to continue interacting with the protocol and benefit financially.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Introduce blacklist checks for the wallet, referrer, and relevant addresses within the DeFi swap functions of the AmirX contract to prevent blacklisted addresses from accessing swap functionality or earning referral fees.
