# Storage collision risk in upgradeable contracts

### Summary

While the contracts use ERC-7201 storage layout, there are potential risks in the storage handling across the inheritance chain and upgrades.

### Root Cause

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-telcoin/blob/main/telcoin-audit/contracts/util/abstract/Blacklist.sol#L19-L20
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-telcoin/blob/main/telcoin-audit/contracts/stablecoin/StablecoinHandler.sol#L57-L58

The contracts use multiple storage slots and inheritance, which could lead to storage collisions if not properly managed during upgrades or if storage gaps aren't properly maintained.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. Contract must be upgraded
2. New implementation must modify storage layout
3. Multiple inherited contracts must access storage

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. If an upgrade introduces new storage variables without proper spacing
2. Storage slots could collide with existing ones from inherited contracts

### Impact

- Data corruption
- Breaking of contract functionality

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Add explicit storage gaps in all upgradeable contracts
