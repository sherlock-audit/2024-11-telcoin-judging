# Swapper can evade fees during stablecoin swaps with completely valid inputs

## Swapper can evade fees during stablecoin swaps with completely valid inputs

## Description

When performing a stablecoin swap, the `SWAPPER_ROLE` can invoke a swap from stable coin to stablecoin. This is largely controlled by the internal `_stablecoinSwap`

```solidity
    function _stablecoinSwap(
        address wallet,
        StablecoinSwap memory ss
    ) internal {
        if (
@>          ss.stablecoinFeeCurrency != address(0) &&
            ss.stablecoinFeeSafe != address(0)
        )
            ERC20PermitUpgradeable(ss.stablecoinFeeCurrency).safeTransferFrom(
                wallet,
                ss.stablecoinFeeSafe,
                ss.feeAmount
            );

        // Handle the transfer or burning of the origin currency:
        // If the origin is a recognized stablecoin (XYZ), burn the specified amount from the wallet.
        if (isXYZ(ss.origin)) {
            Stablecoin(ss.origin).burnFrom(wallet, ss.oAmount);
        } else {
            ERC20PermitUpgradeable(ss.origin).safeTransferFrom(
                wallet,
                ss.liquiditySafe,
                ss.oAmount
            );
        }

        // Handle the minting or transferring of the target currency:
        // If the target is a recognized stablecoin (XYZ), mint the required amount to the destination address.
        if (isXYZ(ss.target)) {
            Stablecoin(ss.target).mintTo(ss.destination, ss.tAmount);
        } else {
            ERC20PermitUpgradeable(ss.target).safeTransferFrom(
                ss.liquiditySafe,
                ss.destination,
                ss.tAmount
            );
        }
    }
```

Notice here the `SWAPPER_ROLE` can utilize the following input:

- `ss.stablecoinFeeCurrency`: Non zero-address
- `ss.stablecoinFeeSafe`: Zero-address
- `ss.feeAmount`: Non-zero amount

Then observe that `_verifyStablecoinSwap` only validates that `liquiditySafe` is a non-zero address, but does not check that `stablecoinFeeSafe` is a non-zero address.

As such, it is possible for a swapper to evade the swapper fee with completely valid inputs as stated above, which is noted to be of a [concern by the sponsor](https://discord.com/channels/812037309376495636/1303735712641712253/1304126992895180921)

> So this was more of an example. Most all the functions on these contracts are protected by roles, and they roles are trusted, however there can still be logic errors pertaining to the inputs provided. My example was that a zero address passed in could cause issues. This isnt necessarily an attack vector where someone could get funds, however we want to focus on logic errors where the normal flow wouldnt allow for the loss of funds because of an oversite on the side of the contract creation

## Proof of Concept

Add this to `describe("Swaps", () => {` in `AmirX.test.ts` and run `npx hardhat test`.

```ts
    describe("two steps", () => {
      it.only("swap", async () => {
        await eUSD.mintTo(holder, 15);
        const stablecoinInputs = {
          liquiditySafe: deployer,
          destination: holder,
          origin: eUSD,
          oAmount: 10,
          target: eMXN,
          tAmount: 100,
          stablecoinFeeCurrency: eUSD,
          stablecoinFeeSafe: ZERO_ADDRESS,
          feeAmount: 5,
        };

        const defiInputs = {
          defiSafe: deployer,
          aggregator: aggregator,
          plugin: plugin,
          feeToken: USDC,
          referrer: ZERO_ADDRESS,
          referralFee: 0,
          walletData: await wallet.getTestSelector(),
          swapData: await aggregator.getSwapSelector(),
        };

        await eUSD.connect(holder).approve(AmirX, 15);
        await telcoin.transfer(aggregator, 10);

        await expect(AmirX.swap(holder, true, stablecoinInputs, defiInputs)).to
          .not.be.reverted;

        expect(await eUSD.totalSupply()).to.equal(5);
        expect(await eUSD.balanceOf(holder)).to.equal(5);
        expect(await eMXN.balanceOf(holder)).to.equal(100);
        expect(await telcoin.balanceOf(deployer)).to.equal(1000);
      });
```

## Impact

Swapper can evade fees.

## Recommendation

In `_verifyStablecoinSwap`, validate that `stablecoinFeeSafe` is a non-zero address when `feeAmount` and `stablecoinFeeCurrency` is non-zero
