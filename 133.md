# Stablecoin swap will have unexpected rate changes due to inaccurate accounting in the `defiToStablecoinSwap`

### Summary

Using a dynamic input for ss.oAmount in the `defiToStablecoinSwap` will result in worse rates for users and possible depegs.

### Root Cause

Calculation the ss.oAmount by using the amount that was received from the swap here will worsen the rate of the stable swap here:

### Attack Path

Stable coins are designed to maintain a stable value by pegging their price to an underlying asset. Most stable coins are backed by collateral that is in the form of the pegged asset. The stable price is guaranteed by the fixed exchange rates.
However when we look into the `defiToStablecoinSwap` function we see that the ss.oAmount is based on the output of the defi swap that is performed.
The defi swap has a minAmountOut parameter which will ensure that the ss.oAmount has enough assets to provide a fair stable rate.
However there is no maxAmountOut. Instead, in the event of slippage the ss.oAmoung will be more than the originally planned ss.oAmount, leading to a trade which will cause some leftover tokens to also pay for the ss.tAmount.

Let's consider the following scenario:
0.A user requests a swap which will need to be a defi - stable swap. In the example the defi swap will be: ETH to eUSD(protocol's stable token ), and the stable swap will be eUSD to USDC which will be pegged 1:1. The swapper calls the swap function with 0.1 eth to swap to USDC.
1.The price at the time of calling will be 1 eth = 840 eUSDC meaning that 0.1 eth will be planned to swap at a min price of 84 eUSDC. However due to market change between the submission of the transaction and its exection the price goes up 2% meaning the swapper will return 85.68 eUSD meaning that now more eUSD tokens will be burned resulting in a rate of 85.68 eUSD for 84 USDC. 

The whole idea of the defiToStablecoinSwap is to combine the two functions from the AmirX.sol contract - defiSwap and StableSwap.
If the user actually uses the `defiToStablecoinSwap`, they will receive less tokens than they would have, if they first used the `defiSwap` and then the `stablecoinSwap` function, because of the wrong update of ss.oAmount pointed out in the root cause.

### Impact

1. Users will not use a fair rate for their second trade in the `defiToStablecoinSwap` function, which will cause them to receive less assets than their ss.oAmount is worth, meaning that the `defiToStablecoinSwap` is useless - Medium
2. There is a possibility for the Stablecoins to depeg due to the excessive amounts that will be burned from the total supply when the `defiToStablecoinSwap` is used without actually changing the collateral that backs it up.

### PoC

N/A

### Mitigation

The best way to mitigate this issue is to specify the ss.oAmount = defiTrade.minAmount out and return any excessive amounts from the defi trade back to the user instead of burning the or sending them to the liquiditySafe.
