# If the fee token is POL, the `_buyBack` function incorrectly uses `msg.value` instead of the amount received from the wallet



### Summary

In the `defiSwap`, if a user tries to swap from a source token into `POL` and the fee token is `POL`:

- The wallet transfers the source token to the aggregator, and the aggregator transfers the swapped `POL` to the wallet.
- The wallet should transfer the fee amount of the received `POL` to the AmirX contract.
- The contract swaps it into TELCOIN using the aggregator.

However, in the `_buyBack` function, it transfers the `msg.value` amount of native tokens from the AmirX contract to the aggregator, instead of the amount received from the wallet. Since the user tries to pay the fee using the swapped `POL`, they do not pay the fee beforehand. In this case, the incorrect use of `msg.value` is a valid issue.

### Root Cause

If `feeToken` is `POL`, the `_buyBack` function swaps `msg.value` amount of `POL` into `TELCOIN` using aggregator from L232.

```solidity
    function _buyBack(
        ERC20 feeToken,
        address aggregator,
        address safe,
        bytes memory swapData
    ) internal {
        if (address(feeToken) == address(0)) return;
        if (address(feeToken) == POL) {
L232:       (bool polSwap, ) = aggregator.call{value: msg.value}(swapData);
            require(polSwap, "AmirX: POL swap transaction failed");
```

### Internal pre-conditions

- User wants to swap erc20 token into `POL` by `defiSwap`.
- Fee token is `POL`.

### External pre-conditions

1. None

### Attack Path

None

### Impact

`defiSwap` reverts due to the incorrect use of `msg.value` to pay the fee

### PoC

None

### Mitigation

- If the fee token is `POL`, add the code so that the wallet transfers the fee amount of `POL` to `AmirX` in the `_buyBack` function.
- Additionally, call the aggregator with the amount of native tokens received from the wallet instead of using `msg.value`.
