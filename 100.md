# Attacker with SUPPORT_ROLE Can Steal Blacklisted Users' Funds


##### Title: Attacker with `SUPPORT_ROLE` Can Steal Blacklisted Users' Funds

---

**Summary**

The missing restriction in the `_onceBlacklisted` function in `Stablecoin.sol` will cause a complete loss of funds for blacklisted users as an attacker with the `SUPPORT_ROLE` can blacklist users and transfer their balances to themselves.

---

**Root Cause**

In [`Stablecoin.sol`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-telcoin/blob/main/telcoin-audit/contracts/stablecoin/Stablecoin.sol#L123-L125), at **line 98**, the `_onceBlacklisted` function is implemented as:

```solidity
// Line 98
function _onceBlacklisted(address user) internal override {
    _transfer(user, _msgSender(), balanceOf(user));
}
```

This function transfers the entire balance of the blacklisted user to the caller (`_msgSender()`), without verifying that the caller is authorized to receive these funds.

---

**Internal Pre-conditions**

1. **Attacker has the `SUPPORT_ROLE`**: The attacker is granted the `SUPPORT_ROLE` in the `Stablecoin` contract.
2. **Victim has a token balance**: The victim user holds a non-zero balance in the `Stablecoin` contract.

---

**Attack Path**

1. **Attacker calls `blacklist(user)`**: The attacker with `SUPPORT_ROLE` invokes the `blacklist` function on the victim's address.
2. **Funds are transferred to attacker**: The `_onceBlacklisted` function is triggered, transferring the victim's entire balance to the attacker (`_msgSender()`).

---

**Impact**

Blacklisted users suffer a **complete loss of their token balances**. The attacker gains the entire balance of the blacklisted users, effectively stealing their funds.

---

**Proof of Concept (PoC)**

Assuming the attacker has been granted the `SUPPORT_ROLE`:

```solidity
// Attacker's address with SUPPORT_ROLE
address attacker = 0xAttackerAddress;

// Victim's address holding tokens
address victim = 0xVictimAddress;

// Instance of the Stablecoin contract
Stablecoin stablecoin = Stablecoin(0xStablecoinAddress);

// Attacker blacklists the victim
stablecoin.blacklist(victim); // Caller is attacker with SUPPORT_ROLE

// The victim's entire balance is transferred to the attacker
assert(stablecoin.balanceOf(victim) == 0);
assert(stablecoin.balanceOf(attacker) == victimInitialBalance);
```

---

**Mitigation**

Modify the `_onceBlacklisted` function to transfer the blacklisted user's balance to a secure, predefined address instead of the caller. For example, in `Stablecoin.sol`:

```solidity
// Replace line 98 with:
function _onceBlacklisted(address user) internal override {
    address BLACKLIST_RECIPIENT = 0xSecureAddress; // Secure address controlled by the protocol
    _transfer(user, BLACKLIST_RECIPIENT, balanceOf(user));
}
```

Additionally, implement strict access controls on the `blacklist` function. Consider requiring multiple signatures or approvals before a user can be blacklisted to prevent abuse of the `SUPPORT_ROLE`.
