# Invariant broken: Missing Validation on defiSafe Could Lead to Loss of Funds

### Summary

The defiSafe parameter, which is a crucial part of the DefiSwap struct, is not validated to ensure it is not set to address(0).
From the contract's perspective and given that the roles (SWAPPER_ROLE) are trusted, it might not always be necessary to prevent defiSafe from being address(0). This is especially true when the contract’s design allows for certain operations to proceed without defiSafe.

But the protocol asserts in the READ.ME that **"if the value for a safe is not passed, tokens should not be able to be sent into space or the zero address."** This statement indicates that if defiSafe is not provided, it should be treated as an invalid state or, at the very least, the contract should ensure no transfers to address(0) occur. However, this assertion is not currently enforced in the code

Thus, if defiSafe is set to address(0) in an unexpected situation, **it could break the intended behavior of the protocol, which would be a loss of funds.**

### Root Cause

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-telcoin/blob/main/telcoin-audit/contracts/swap/AmirX.sol#L171

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-telcoin/blob/main/telcoin-audit/contracts/swap/AmirX.sol#L209C9-L214C6

The issue lies in the [_defiSwap()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-telcoin/blob/main/telcoin-audit/contracts/swap/AmirX.sol#L166) and [_feeDispersal()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-telcoin/blob/main/telcoin-audit/contracts/swap/AmirX.sol#L183) functions, which handle fee dispersal and swaps for the DeFi protocol. Specifically, when defiSafe is set to address(0), the contract will attempt to send tokens to the zero address, which effectively burns them.

This bug occurs because there is no explicit check to validate that defiSafe is not address(0) before attempting to perform token transfers in the _feeDispersal() function. The contract assumes that, due to trusted roles, the inputs will be correct, but this assumption is not foolproof.

**Note** that this is not the usual lack of address(0) which is normally considered as invalid. This breaks the invariant indicated in the design choice of the protocol as seen in the read.ME. Again, The protocol asserted that, "The contract is constructed so that most inputs can be ignored in nearly any flow unless this would lead to a loss of funds. For example, the protocol may chose not to perform a buyback, are accept a fee, etc. However is the value for a safe is not passed in tokens should not be able to be sent into space or the zero address"

Hence, this is a valid issue.
```solidity
function _feeDispersal(DefiSwap memory defi) internal {
    // must buy into TEL
    if (defi.feeToken != TELCOIN)
        _buyBack(
            defi.feeToken,
            defi.aggregator,
            defi.defiSafe,
            defi.swapData
        );

    // distribute reward
    if (defi.referrer != address(0) && defi.referralFee != 0) {
        TELCOIN.forceApprove(address(defi.plugin), 0);
        TELCOIN.safeIncreaseAllowance(
            address(defi.plugin),
            defi.referralFee
        );
        require(
            defi.plugin.increaseClaimableBy(
                defi.referrer,
                defi.referralFee
            ),
            "AmirX: balance was not adjusted"
        );
    }

    // retain remainder
    if (TELCOIN.balanceOf(address(this)) > 0)
        TELCOIN.safeTransfer(
            defi.defiSafe,
            TELCOIN.balanceOf(address(this))
        );
}
```


### Internal pre-conditions

1. When the contract’s design allows for certain operations to proceed without defiSafe, defiSafe will be default address which is address (0).
2.` _feeDispersal` is triggered and since the contract assumes that the role will provide a valid address for defiSafe, but this is not guaranteed by any check or safeguard

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

1. Any attempt to transfer funds to defiSafe when it is address(0) will result in those tokens being irretrievably lost (burned).
2. Breaks the invariant of the protocol in Read.ME that says, "However if the value for a safe is not passed in tokens should not be able to be sent into space or the zero address."

### PoC

To demonstrate the bug:

1. The SWAPPER_ROLE calls defiSwap() or _defiSwap() with a DefiSwap struct that has defiSafe = address(0).
2. The contract will attempt to transfer any remaining tokens (e.g., TELCOIN) to address(0).
3. The result is that tokens will be permanently destroyed

### Mitigation

Before transferring any tokens, the contract should check that defiSafe != address(0) to prevent tokens from being sent to the zero address.

Example check:

```solidity
require(defi.defiSafe != address(0), "DefiSafe address cannot be zero.");
```
