# A user will receive a wrong number of tokens when swapping stablecoins

### Summary

Whenever a user swaps stablecoins, through `swap` or `defiToStablecoinSwap` the number of tokens that need to be burned may be set to a new value:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-telcoin/blob/b9c751b59e78a7123a636e31ecafc9147046f190/telcoin-audit/contracts/swap/AmirX.sol#L93
```solidity
if (fBalance - iBalance != 0) ss.oAmount = fBalance - iBalance;
```

This, however, is an issue as if the `oAmount` of tokens changes, the `tAmount` of tokens that will get minted stays the same. Thus, the wallet of the user will either receive more or fewer tokens than it should, depending on how `oAmount` is updated.

### Root Cause

In the `swap` and `defiToStablecoinSwap` functions of AmirX the `oAmount` of the origin token may increase/decrease, however, the `tAmount` of the target token stays the same. This issue cannot be prevented by the Swapper, as the `tAmount` will be calculated based on the initial `oAmount`, even if it later changes.

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. Swapper initiates a swap with `oAmount = 1e18` and `tAmount = 2e18`
2. The `oAmount` is set to 0.5e18 in the `swap` function, however, `tAmount` stays the same
3. Thus, the wallet will be minted two times the number of target tokens that they should have

### Impact

A wallet may receive more/fewer tokens than intended, which is detrimental to the protocol.

### Mitigation

Make sure that `tAmount` is recalculated if `oAmount` has been updated.
