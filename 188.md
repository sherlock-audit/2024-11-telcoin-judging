# When feeToken is target token, `stablecoinSwap` will revert

### Summary

- When user calls `stablecoinSwap` for USDC to eUSD and feeToken is eUSD, `stablecoinSwap` function will revert.
- For example, user wants to swap 100 USDC for 100 eUSD and feeToken is eUSD.
- Now fee amount will be transferFrom wallet to stablecoinFeeSafe but wallet will not hold eUSD yet.
- Wallet will have only USDC which he wants to swap for eUSD so that this will revert.
```solidity
 ERC20PermitUpgradeable(ss.stablecoinFeeCurrency).safeTransferFrom(
                wallet,
                ss.stablecoinFeeSafe,
                ss.feeAmount
            );
```
- This can be also possible in `defiToStablecoinSwap` where user wants to swap AAVE-USDC-eUSD and feeToken will be eUSD.
- Same thing happen and wallet will not have eUSD so that it will revert as mentioned above.

### Root Cause

- When target token is feeToken, wallet will not have feeToken and it will revert.
