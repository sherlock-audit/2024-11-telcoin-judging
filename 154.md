# The `defiToStablecoinSwap` reverts because the wallet does not approve the `ss.origin` token for the `AmirX` contract

### Summary

The `defiToStablecoinSwap` function performs stablecoin swapping using the tokens received from the defi swap. In the `_stablecoinSwap` function, it either burns `ss.oAmount` of `ss.origin` tokens from the wallet or transfers them from the wallet to `ss.liquiditySafe`. However, the wallet does not approve the `ss.oAmount` of `ss.origin` tokens for the `AmirX` contract. As a result, this causes the `defiToStablecoinSwap` function to revert.

### Root Cause

The `defiToStablecoinSwap` function sets the `ss.oAmount` as delta balance of wallet's `ss.origin` token from L125.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-telcoin/blob/b9c751b59e78a7123a636e31ecafc9147046f190/telcoin-audit/contracts/swap/AmirX.sol#L125

```solidity
        uint256 iBalance = ERC20(ss.origin).balanceOf(wallet);
        _defiSwap(wallet, defi);
        uint256 fBalance = ERC20(ss.origin).balanceOf(wallet);
L125:    ss.oAmount = fBalance - iBalance;
        //change balance to reflect change
       _stablecoinSwap(wallet, ss);
```

Let's assume that user wants to swap `AAVE -> USDC -> eUSD`.
The defi swapping swaps `AAVE` into `USDC` and stable coin swapping swaps delta `USDC` balance into `eUSD` from L127.
In the `_stablecoinSwap` function, it transfers `ss.oAmount` amount of `USDC` token from wallet to `ss.liquiditySafe`.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-telcoin/blob/b9c751b59e78a7123a636e31ecafc9147046f190/telcoin-audit/contracts/swap/AmirX.sol#L168

```solidity
        if (isXYZ(ss.origin)) {
            Stablecoin(ss.origin).burnFrom(wallet, ss.oAmount);
        } else {
L163:       ERC20PermitUpgradeable(ss.origin).safeTransferFrom(
                wallet,
                ss.liquiditySafe,
                ss.oAmount
            );
        }
```

However, the `AmirX` contract is not approved to spend the `ss.oAmount` of `USDC` tokens from the wallet.

The `wallet` behaves like a gnosis safe and it can only do one transaction at a time and the sponsor acknowledged about this during contest.
This means that `defi.walletData` contains only the transaction of swapping, not contain approval transaction.
As a result, the `defiToStablecoinSwap` function reverts.

### Internal pre-conditions

User wants `defiToStablecoinSwap`.

### External pre-conditions

1. None

### Attack Path

None

### Impact

`defiToStablecoinSwap` reverts.

### PoC

None

### Mitigation

In the `defiToStablecoinSwap` function, add the code to approve the `ss.oAmount` amount of `ss.origin` token from `wallet` to `AmirX` contract.
