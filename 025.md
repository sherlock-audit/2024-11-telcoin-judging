# Code is breaking `READme` by not implementing according to the mentioned design decision

### Summary

All swap functions like `swap`, `defiToStablecoinSwap`, `stablecoinToDefiSwap`, `defiSwap` calls the internal function `_defiSwap` to do a swap with `walletData`. `_defiSwap` then calls `_feeDispersal` where referral fees are sent to referrer if available, then other fees is sent to the `defi safe` address. If the fee token is Telcoin, then no swap is done and directly sent to safe address, or else swapped  and sent to safe address via `_buyBack` call. Fee token can be POL, TELCOIN, or other tokens. If there are any extra tokens after swap, they are also sent to safe address without swapping.


### Root Cause



Fee tokens (TELCOIN, POL, others. Sent without swap and also after swap) are sent to `safe address` during `_feeDispersal` even if safe address is not passed in swap function. Readme says, funds should not be lost in case `safe` address is not passed in, so code should avoid sending the fee tokens. But code is not checking if safe address is passed in or not, sending the Telcoins all the time. And this is breaking the design design decision mentioned in the [readme](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-telcoin#q-please-discuss-any-design-choices-you-made). 


### Internal pre-conditions



Safe address not passed in during swap



### External pre-conditions

### Attack Path


`Please discuss any design choices you made.` : https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-telcoin#q-please-discuss-any-design-choices-you-made

The issue is, Readme’s design choice says `most inputs can be ignored in nearly any flow unless this would lead to a loss of funds`. Also gives an example `However is the value for a safe is not passed in tokens should not be able to be sent into space or the zero address.`

Meaning, the protocol will perform swap with `safe is not passed in` so that no fees tokens are not sent out. But, regardless of safe address being passed in or not, the fee tokens are sent out. IF the fee token is not TELCOIN, then they are swapped and sent out, and any remaining non-telcoin fee token after swap, are also sent directly to safe address. these will be lost if safe address not passed in.

This is against the design decision. The code is not following the design decision mentioned in the readme, that `if a safe address is not passed in, then tokens are not sent to safe or 0 address`.

```

### Impact


Code is not implementing readme’s design decision, so there by breaking the Readme. So medium. loss of fee tokens if safe address not passed in.


### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation



Follow the design decision mentioned in readme
