# incorrect assumption can be problematic

### Summary

This part of the code is inside the swap function, which is responsible for handling both DeFi and stablecoin swaps.



                uint256 iBalance = ERC20(ss.origin).balanceOf(wallet);
                if (defi.walletData.length != 0) _defiSwap(wallet, defi);
                uint256 fBalance = ERC20(ss.origin).balanceOf(wallet);
                //change balance to reflect change
                if (fBalance - iBalance != 0) ss.oAmount = fBalance - iBalance;


this line captures the initial balance of the user's ss.origin token (the token the user is going to swap from) before any operation happens. It does this by calling the balanceOf function

            if (defi.walletData.length != 0) _defiSwap(wallet, defi);
If there is a DeFi swap, the function _defiSwap(wallet, defi) is called

            uint256 fBalance = ERC20(ss.origin).balanceOf(wallet);
After performing the DeFi swap this line captures the final balance of ss.origin token after the swap. The idea is to check how the balance has changed as a result of the operation

            if (fBalance - iBalance != 0) ss.oAmount = fBalance - iBalance;
This line calculates the difference between the final balance (fBalance) and the initial balance (iBalance). This difference represents the amount of tokens spent or received due to the DeFi swap

             if (fBalance - iBalance != 0) ss.oAmount = fBalance - iBalance;
If the balance has changed (i.e., fBalance - iBalance != 0), it adjusts the amount. The oAmount represents the current balance of the wallet however the code assumes that fbalance (received amount) which can be wronf and if the initial balance every exceeds this code will fail to capture the users balance

### Root Cause

### Internal pre-conditions

balance exceeds received amount

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

loss of funds for users if balance ever exceeds received amount as the code will fail to capture the latest balance

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

remove the check check if the amount received is more than initial balance
