# ### Summary

### Summary

The protocol’s `_swap` function currently attempts to reset token allowances to zero before re-approving a new amount. However, certain tokens, such as BNB, revert when a zero-value approval is attempted. This behavior causes a complete failure of any transaction involving these tokens within the protocol, as the `_swap` function fails when it tries to reset the approval. This issue affects swaps that involve these tokens, breaking protocol functionality for any token that reverts on zero approvals.


### Root Cause


## Proof of Concept
The vulnerability lies in the `_swap` function, where the protocol tries to reset approvals for tokens by setting allowances to zero before re-approving. This approach fails for tokens like BNB, which revert on zero-value approvals. As a result, any swap transaction involving such tokens will fail when `_swap` attempts to reset the approval. 

### Affected Code:
```solidity
function _swap(IERC20 tokenIn, IERC20 tokenOut, uint256 amountIn, uint256 amountOutMin, bytes memory swapData) internal returns (uint256 amountInDelta, uint256 amountOutDelta) {
    if (amountIn != 0 && swapData.length != 0 && address(tokenOut) != address(0)) {
        // approve needed amount
        _safeApprove(tokenIn, swapRouter, amountIn);

        // execute swap
        (bool success,) = swapRouter.call(swapData);
        if (!success) {
            revert ("swap failed!");
        }

        // reset approval
        //@audit resetting the approval would never work for these tokens
        _safeApprove(tokenIn, swapRouter, 0);

        // additional processing...
    }
}
```


Relevant Protocol Documentation:  
The protocol explicitly acknowledges that it intends to support tokens expected to behave as standard ERC-20 tokens. However, the use of `_safeApprove(tokenIn, swapRouter, 0);` in `_swap` breaks the functionality for any token that reverts on zero-value approvals. This design causes failures specifically for tokens that disallow setting approvals to zero before re-approving.

### Mitigation

## Recommended Mitigation Steps
To ensure compatibility with tokens that revert on zero-value approvals, consider using a conditional mechanism for resetting allowances. If the zero-value approval fails, use an alternate reset method. Here’s an updated `_safeResetAndApprove` function that could help in mitigating this issue:

```solidity
function _safeResetAndApprove(IERC20 token, address _spender, uint256 _value) internal {
    // Attempt to reset allowance to zero; catch any errors
    try token.approve(_spender, 0) {} catch {
        // Handle tokens that revert on zero-approval
    }
    // Set the desired allowance value (non-zero)
    require(_value > 0, "Approval value must be greater than zero");
    _safeApprove(token, _spender, _value);
}
```

By incorporating `_safeResetAndApprove` in `_swap`, the protocol can handle tokens that do not allow zero-value approvals, while ensuring the required allowance for future transfers is set. Alternatively, the protocol could limit support to tokens that do not revert on zero-value approvals.
