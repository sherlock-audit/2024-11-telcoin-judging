# `rescueCrypto::AmirX.sol` lacks recipient parameter to securely return funds to the intended recipient

### Summary

The `rescueCrypto` function does not allow specifying a recipient address, instead sending funds to the caller with SUPPORT_ROLE. This design could lead to funds being sent to an unintended recipient, as there is no option to specify the original sender. Including a recipient parameter would improve security and prevent potential fund misdirection, while also potentially reducing fees by streamlining transfers.

### Root Cause

- Lack of Recipient Parameter: The function sends funds to the caller with SUPPORT_ROLE (_msgSender()), rather than allowing funds to be sent to the actual intended recipient without checking the real amount sent by mistake.
- Missed Opportunity for Direct Return: Without a recipient parameter, funds mistakenly sent to the contract cannot be returned directly to the original sender, increasing operational complexity.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. An account with SUPPORT_ROLE calls rescueCrypto to return misdirected funds.
2. The intended recipient of the funds is different from the SUPPORT_ROLE.

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

- Funds sent to an unintended recipient: The current setup may lead to funds being sent to SUPPORT_ROLE rather than the actual intended address.
- Increased Transaction Fees: The inability to specify a recipient can lead to additional transfers to correct fund routing, raising gas fees.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

1. Add Recipient Parameter: Modify rescueCrypto to accept an address recipient parameter to specify the intended wallet for funds recovery.
2. Ensure Balance Sufficiency Check: Before transferring, confirm that the contract balance is sufficient to cover the requested amount.
