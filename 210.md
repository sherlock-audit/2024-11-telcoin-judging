# Inconsistent Swap Execution Due to Ambiguous `directional` Logic

### Summary

The reliance on secondary conditions like `walletData.length` instead of making `directional` the sole determinant will cause unintended swap flows for users as the `swap()` function executes both DeFi and stablecoin swaps when only one swap was expected.

### Root Cause

The choice to rely on both `directional` and `walletData.length` to control the [swap flow](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-telcoin/blob/main/telcoin-audit/contracts/swap/AmirX.sol#L73) is a mistake as this creates ambiguity, resulting in inconsistent and unintended execution paths.

### Internal pre-conditions

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. `SWAPPER_ROLE` calls `swap()` with `directional` set to true and `walletData.length` non-zero.
2. Both `_defiSwap()` and `_stablecoinSwap()` execute even when only one was expected, adjusting `ss.oAmount` based on incorrect balance differentials.
3. The user receives an incorrect token amount due to unexpected swap sequencing.

### Impact

Users experience incorrect token amounts or unexpected swap flows, causing an approximate loss due to mismatched token balances. The protocol risks users losing confidence in its consistency and reliability.

### PoC

1. Call `swap()` with `directional` set to true and `walletData.length` populated.
2. Observe the execution of both `_defiSwap()` and `_stablecoinSwap()` and the resulting value of `ss.oAmount`.

### Mitigation

1. `Enforce `directional` as the Sole Controller:` Refactor `swap()` so `directional` fully dictates swap order, eliminating reliance on `walletData.length`.
2. `Separate Execution Paths:` Distinguish clearly between DeFi-only, stablecoin-only, and combined swaps to avoid unintended dual executions.
