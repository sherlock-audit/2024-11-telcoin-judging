# Residual `TELCOIN` Balance May Remain in Contract Due to Unchecked Transfer


**Title:** Residual `TELCOIN` Balance May Remain in Contract Due to Unchecked Transfer

---

**Summary**

The missing success check in the residual balance transfer in `AmirX.sol` will cause potential fund lock-up as any failure in transferring `TELCOIN` to `defi.defiSafe` goes unnoticed, leaving tokens stuck in the contract.

---

**Root Cause**

In [`AmirX.sol`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-telcoin/blob/main/telcoin-audit/contracts/swap/AmirX.sol#L209-L214), at **lines 153-154**, the residual balance transfer lacks a success check:

```solidity
// Lines 209-214
if (TELCOIN.balanceOf(address(this)) > 0)
    TELCOIN.safeTransfer(
        defi.defiSafe,
        TELCOIN.balanceOf(address(this))
    );
```

There is no verification that the `safeTransfer` operation was successful. If the transfer fails, the contract retains the `TELCOIN`, leading to potential fund lock-up.

---

**Internal Pre-conditions**

1. **Contract holds residual `TELCOIN` balance**: After operations, the contract has a remaining `TELCOIN` balance.
2. **Transfer to `defi.defiSafe` may fail**: The recipient address may reject the transfer, or the transfer might fail due to other reasons.

---

**Attack Path**

1. **Residual balance exists**: The contract attempts to transfer the remaining `TELCOIN`.
2. **Transfer fails silently**: Without a success check, the failure goes unnoticed.
3. **Tokens remain in contract**: Funds are locked, and accounting discrepancies occur.

---

**Impact**

The contract retains residual `TELCOIN` balances, leading to **potential fund lock-up and inconsistencies in accounting**. Users and administrators may be unaware of the locked funds, which could affect contract operations and financial integrity.

---

**Proof of Concept (PoC)**

If `defi.defiSafe` is a contract that does not accept `TELCOIN` transfers or if there is an issue with the `TELCOIN` token contract itself (e.g., it returns `false` instead of reverting on failure), the `safeTransfer` may not succeed, and the contract will retain the tokens without notification.

---

**Mitigation**

Add a success check for the transfer to ensure that any failure is detected and handled appropriately:

```solidity
// Replace lines 153-154 with:
if (TELCOIN.balanceOf(address(this)) > 0) {
    bool success = TELCOIN.transfer(
        defi.defiSafe,
        TELCOIN.balanceOf(address(this))
    );
    require(success, "AmirX: TELCOIN transfer failed");
}
```

Alternatively, use `safeTransfer` and handle any exceptions:

```solidity
// Using safeTransfer with try-catch
if (TELCOIN.balanceOf(address(this)) > 0) {
    try TELCOIN.safeTransfer(
        defi.defiSafe,
        TELCOIN.balanceOf(address(this))
    ) {
        // Transfer successful
    } catch {
        // Handle transfer failure
        revert("AmirX: TELCOIN transfer failed");
    }
}
```

This ensures that any failure in transferring residual balances is caught, allowing the contract to handle it appropriately.
