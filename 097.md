# No emit event for `stablecoinSwap` function of `StablecoinHandler`

### Impact
A missing event for an important state change in a Solidity contract is generally considered a **medium/high-severity** bug.

While it doesn't directly compromise the security of the contract, it can significantly hinder debugging and troubleshooting.

Without event logs, it becomes more difficult to track the state changes in the contract.

Sometimes, if the missing event is related to a critical state change, such as a significant transfer of funds or a change in ownership, it could be considered a **high-severity** issue.

### PoC

There should be an event to be emitted when dealing with critical state changes.

Here we can see that the `stablecoinSwap` function of `StablecoinHandler` is not emitting any event.

```solidity
function stablecoinSwap(
    address wallet,
    StablecoinSwap memory ss
) external onlyRole(SWAPPER_ROLE) whenNotPaused {
    // Verify the swap details before proceeding with the operation.
    _verifyStablecoinSwap(wallet, ss);
    // Perform the stablecoin swap after validation.
    _stablecoinSwap(wallet, ss);
}
```

### Mitigation

 Emit an event for the `stablecoinSwap` function.
