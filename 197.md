# `AmirX._feeDispersal` will incorrectly send entire TELCOIN balance instead of buyback remainder after referral fee dispersal

### Summary

A missing balance tracking in `AmirX._feeDispersal` will cause unintended loss of `TELCOIN` tokens for users as the function sends the contract's entire `TELCOIN` balance to `defiSafe` instead of only sending the remainder of buyback `TELCOIN` after referral fee dispersal. This leads to any pre-existing `TELCOIN` balance in the contract being unintentionally swept along with the fee remainder.

### Root Cause

In [`AmirX.sol:209-213`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-telcoin/blob/main/telcoin-audit/contracts/swap/AmirX.sol#L209-L213) the missing balance tracking before and after the referral fee dispersal operation causes the function to transfer the contract's entire `TELCOIN` balance instead of the remainder of buyback `TELCOIN` after referral fee dispersal, such that the function uses `TELCOIN.balanceOf(address(this))` to send all available `TELCOIN` to `defiSafe` address without considering tokens that may have been in the contract prior to the current operation. 

### Internal pre-conditions

1. Contract must have some pre-existing `TELCOIN` balance from other sources or operations prior to the current fee dispersal
2. A valid `defiSwap` operation must be executed that involves either converting `non-TELCOIN` fees to `TELCOIN` or handling `TELCOIN` fees directly
3. The `defiSafe` address in the `DefiSwap` struct must be set to a non-zero address

### External pre-conditions

No specific external protocol conditions required

### Attack Path

1. User or other protocol component sends `TELCOIN` to the `AmirX` contract directly or through other valid operations (this creates the pre-existing balance)
2. The `SWAPPER_ROLE` calls `AmirX.defiSwap()` with a valid `DefiSwap` struct
3. The `_defiSwap()` function calls `_feeDispersal()` with the provided `DefiSwap` parameters
4. When `_feeDispersal()` processes the fee dispersal:
    - It converts `non-TELCOIN` fees to `TELCOIN` if needed
    - It handles any referral fee distributions
    - Finally, it calls `TELCOIN.safeTransfer(defi.defiSafe, TELCOIN.balanceOf(address(this)))`, sending ALL `TELCOIN` balance
5. The pre-existing TELCOIN balance is unintentionally transferred along with the actual fee remainder

### Impact

The protocol suffers unintended loss of `TELCOIN` tokens that were present in the contract before the fee dispersal operation. The tokens are sent to the `defiSafe` address instead of remaining in the contract for their intended purpose. While these tokens can potentially be recovered through the `rescueCrypto` function by a `SUPPORT_ROLE` holder, this requires manual intervention and monitoring. The attacker does not gain from this vulnerability since tokens are sent to the controlled `defiSafe` address, making this more of a protocol operational issue than a direct value extraction vulnerability.

### Mitigation

```solidity
function _feeDispersal(DefiSwap memory defi) internal {    
    // Store TELCOIN balance before buyback
    uint256 beforeBuybackBalance = TELCOIN.balanceOf(address(this));

    // Execute buyback if needed
    if (defi.feeToken != TELCOIN)
        _buyBack(
            defi.feeToken,
            defi.aggregator,
            defi.defiSafe,
            defi.swapData
        );

    // Calculate the amount of TELCOIN buyback
    uint256 buybackAmount = TELCOIN.balanceOf(address(this)) - beforeBuybackBalance;

    // Store TELCOIN balance before referral fee dispersal
    uint256 beforeReferBalance = TELCOIN.balanceOf(address(this));

    // Handle referral fees
    if (defi.referrer != address(0) && defi.referralFee != 0) {
        TELCOIN.forceApprove(address(defi.plugin), 0);
        TELCOIN.safeIncreaseAllowance(
            address(defi.plugin),
            defi.referralFee
        );
        require(
            defi.plugin.increaseClaimableBy(
                defi.referrer,
                defi.referralFee
            ),
            "AmirX: balance was not adjusted"
        );
    }

    // Calculate the amount of TELCOIN referral fee dispersal
    uint256 referralFeeAmount = beforeReferBalance - TELCOIN.balanceOf(address(this));

    // Transfer the remainder of buyback TELCOIN to defiSafe address
    uint256 remainder = buybackAmount - referralFeeAmount;
    if (remainder > 0) {
        TELCOIN.safeTransfer(defi.defiSafe, remainder);
    }
}
