# User will make a stable coin go below the minimum limit of the total supply breaking core protocol functionality

### Summary

A wrong validation check in the swap function will allow a user to burn even below the min burn amount.

### Root Cause

In the swap function the validation of the StablecoinSwap paramer is done in the beginning of the function here:

Which performs the following check:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-telcoin/blob/b9c751b59e78a7123a636e31ecafc9147046f190/telcoin-audit/contracts/stablecoin/StablecoinHandler.sol#L205
However we can see a parameter is changed after the validation here:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-telcoin/blob/b9c751b59e78a7123a636e31ecafc9147046f190/telcoin-audit/contracts/swap/AmirX.sol#L93
In case when ss.oAmount increases due to slippage in the defi swap that is performed, the new ss.oAmount can easily go below the minLimit for the total supply of the token.


### Internal pre-conditions

-Can be performed anytime given the external pre-conditions are at place.

### External pre-conditions

-The total supply of the token should be close to the minimum prior to calling the transaction
-There should be slippage that will increase the ss.oAmount to go beyond the minimum total supply

### Attack Path

0. A user requests a swap which will need to be a defi - stable swap. In the example the defi swap will be: ETH to eUSD(protocol's stable token ), and the stable swap will be eUSD to USDC which will be pegged 1:1.
1. At the time of the swap the total supply of eUSD is 100 and the minimum is 15. The swapper calls the swap function with 0.1 eth to swap to USDC. 
2. The price at the time of calling will be 1 eth = 840 eUSDC meaning that 0.1 eth will be planned to swap at a min price of 84 eUSDC. However due to market change between the submission of the transaction and its exection the price goes up 2% meaning the swapper will return 85.68 eUSD which will cause the eUSD to burn 85.68 eUSD going below the 15 eUSD minimum total supply => 100-85.68 = 14.32 eUSD<15eUSd

### Impact

The developers have given a high priority of the functionality that ensures that total supply of the protocol's stable token does not go beyond the specified minimum.
Given that the code performs insufficient validation which breaks core contract invariant and functionality I consider it Medium.

### PoC

N/A

### Mitigation

Validate the new ss.oAmount after chaning it here:
