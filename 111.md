# Fee on Transfer Tokens May Result in Insufficient Fee Sent to stablecoinFeeSafe

### Summary

When using fee on transfer tokens in the [_stablecoinSwap](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-telcoin/blob/main/telcoin-audit/contracts/stablecoin/StablecoinHandler.sol#L144) function, the fee amount (ss.feeAmount) specified by the caller may be reduced during the transfer due to the token's inherent fee mechanism, potentially leading to insufficient funds being sent to the stablecoinFeeSafe. This can result in the system failing to correctly process the required fee.

### Root Cause

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-telcoin/blob/main/telcoin-audit/contracts/stablecoin/StablecoinHandler.sol#L151C10-L156C15

The issue lies in how the transfer of ss.feeAmount is handled for fee on transfer tokens in the following code:

```solidity
ERC20PermitUpgradeable(ss.stablecoinFeeCurrency).safeTransferFrom(
    wallet,
    ss.stablecoinFeeSafe,
    ss.feeAmount
);
```
Some ERC-20 tokens automatically deduct a portion of the transfer amount as a fee when they are sent. For example, if the fee on transfer is 10%, only 90% of the ss.feeAmount will be transferred, and the remaining 10% will be deducted as a fee.

If there is no check to ensure ss.feeAmount specified by the swapper correctly accounts for the fee on transfer, the actual amount received at the stablecoinFeeSafe will be less than expected. This can cause the system to fail to meet the expected fee requirements,

### Internal pre-conditions

1. ss.stablecoinFeeCurrency is a fee on transfer token (e.g., one that deducts a portion of the transfer amount automatically).
2. The swapper specifies ss.feeAmount without adjusting for the potential loss caused by the fee on transfer.

### External pre-conditions

1. The token being used has a built-in transfer fee that is deducted from every transfer. This behavior is not directly accounted for in the _stablecoinSwap function.

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

The stablecoinFeeSafe may receive less than the expected fee amount due to the automatic deduction of fees by the token.

### PoC

1. A swapper calls _stablecoinSwap with a fee on transfer token (e.g., 10% fee on transfers).
2. The swapper specifies ss.feeAmount = 100 tokens to be sent to stablecoinFeeSafe.
3. The token has a 10% fee on transfers, so only 90 tokens are actually transferred to stablecoinFeeSafe.
4. The remaining 10 tokens are deducted as a fee, resulting in the stablecoinFeeSafe receiving less than the expected amount.

### Mitigation

Introduce a check for fee on transfer tokens to calculate the effective transfer amount and adjust feeAmount accordingly.
Example:

```solidity
if (isFeeOnTransferToken(ss.stablecoinFeeCurrency)) {
    uint256 adjustedFeeAmount = calculateFeeWithTransfer(ss.stablecoinFeeCurrency, ss.feeAmount);
    ERC20PermitUpgradeable(ss.stablecoinFeeCurrency).safeTransferFrom(
        wallet,
        ss.stablecoinFeeSafe,
        adjustedFeeAmount
    );
} else {
    ERC20PermitUpgradeable(ss.stablecoinFeeCurrency).safeTransferFrom(
        wallet,
        ss.stablecoinFeeSafe,
        ss.feeAmount
    );
}
```
