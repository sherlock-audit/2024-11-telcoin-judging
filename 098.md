# User has to pay the defi swap fee twice.

### Summary

In the defi swap function, when swap occurs a swap fee is sent into the Amirix contract, if the feeToken is native token (POL), the `buyback` internal function requires the user to send in native token and only uses the native token sent (msg.value) to swap for telecoin tokens, while the rest will be sent to the safe.

### Root Cause

In [AmirixL#232](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-telcoin/blob/main/telcoin-audit/contracts/swap/AmirX.sol#L232) the msg.value is used as the input for the swap to the telecoin token but the swap fee is not sent with the contract call.

### Internal pre-conditions

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

- User calls swap without sending native token as swap fee 
- The swap occurs and the native token (POL) is sent to the AmiriX contract as a swap Fee
- The buyback function uses the native token sent in as a fee, hence the call to the aggregator to swap the fee for telecoin tokens will fail. 

### Impact

The swap will fail unless the user pays the swap fee twice (i.e. when the call is made to defi swap and after the swap has occurred).

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Use the balance of the contract after the defi swap as the amount sent to the aggregator in the `_buyback` function to swap for telecoin tokens
