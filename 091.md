# Anyone can burn StableCoin tokens  with `burnFrom` function

### SUMMARY

Anyone can burn `Stablecoin` tokens with `burnFrom` function inherited of **ERC20PermitUpgradeable** contract.

### VULNERABILITY DETAILS

In the **StableCoin** contract, the `burn` function is `onlyRole` and is used by the contract, which is the owner of **StableCoin** contract.

Check Line of code:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-telcoin/blob/main/telcoin-audit/contracts/stablecoin/Stablecoin.sol#L106

From the code above , the onlyRole modifier can be bypassed, which means that anyone can burn tokens without permission.
