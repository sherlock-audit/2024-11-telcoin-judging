# Blacklisted Addresses Can Still Interact Via defiSwap

### Summary

Lack of blacklist validation in defiSwap function could accidentally allow blacklisted addresses to execute trades if a SWAPPER_ROLE processes their request without checking blacklist status, potentially undermining the blacklist security mechanism.

### Root Cause

In AmirX.sol, the defiSwap function only checks if the wallet address is zero but fails to validate against the blacklist status:

### Internal pre-conditions

Address needs to be blacklisted by blacklister role

SWAPPER_ROLE processes a swap request without manually checking blacklist status

Contract must not be paused

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

Address gets blacklisted for legitimate reasons

Blacklisted address submits a swap request through normal channels

SWAPPER_ROLE, unaware of blacklist status, processes the request through defiSwap

Transaction succeeds despite blacklist status as there's no automatic check

Blacklisted address successfully executes trades

### Impact

The effectiveness of the blacklist mechanism is reduced as blacklisted addresses might accidentally have their trades processed. 

This creates additional operational burden on SWAPPER_ROLE who must manually check blacklist status, and increases the risk of accidental processing of blacklisted trades.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Add automatic blacklist check in _verifyDefiSwap function:

```Solidity
function _verifyDefiSwap(address wallet, DefiSwap memory defi) internal view {
    // Add blacklist check here
    require(!Blacklist(stablecoin).blacklisted(wallet), "AmirX: wallet blacklisted");
    
    // existing checks...
}
```
