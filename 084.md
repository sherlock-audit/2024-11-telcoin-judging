# The contract incorrectly uses msg.value instead of the contract's accumulated POL balance when performing buyback operations, preventing the proper conversion of collected POL fees to TELCOIN

### Summary

The AmirX.sol incorrectly processes POL (Polygon/MATIC) fees during buyback operations by using msg.value instead of the contract's actual POL balance. This prevents the contract from converting POL fees into TELCOIN as intended.

### Root Cause

`function _buyBack(
    ERC20 feeToken,
    address aggregator,
    address safe,
    bytes memory swapData
) internal {
    if (address(feeToken) == POL) {
        (bool polSwap, ) = aggregator.call{value: msg.value}(swapData);
        require(polSwap, "AmirX: POL swap transaction failed");
    }
}`

The bug occurs because the function uses msg.value for the swap amount instead of address(this).balance, which represnts the contract's actual POL balance

Assume a user wants to swap pol = 50
User balance:50 POL
// 1. User performs a swap with 10% fee(assuming 10% fee)
Transaction {
    from: user
    value: 50 POL
    fee: 5 POL (10%)
}
// 2. Result after swap
AmirX balance: 5 POL (fee collected) (note: the balance of the contracts pol can be anythingthis issue will still occur){5 pol is just assuming contract had 0 pol before} 
User receives: xyz token according to there swap
// 3. Buyback attempt
buyBack() {
    // Uses msg.value instead of contract balance (5 POL)
    aggregator.call{value: 0}(swapData) 
}
// 4. Final state
AmirX balance: 5 POL
TELCOIN received: 0 


### Internal pre-conditions

The buyback function must be triggered

### External pre-conditions

1)POL must be specified as the fee token

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

1)POL fees accumulate in contract without conversion
2) Protocol loses opportunity to acquire TELCOIN
3) The contract accumulates POL fees over time that need to be swapped

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

_No response_
