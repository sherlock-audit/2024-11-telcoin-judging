# wrong balance check

### Summary

This part of the code is inside the swap function, which is responsible for handling both DeFi and stablecoin swaps. 

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-telcoin/blob/main/telcoin-audit/contracts/swap/AmirX.sol#L89-L93

                uint256 iBalance = ERC20(ss.origin).balanceOf(wallet);

this line captures the initial balance of the user's ss.origin token (the token the user is going to swap from) before any operation happens. It does this by calling the balanceOf function

                if (defi.walletData.length != 0) _defiSwap(wallet, defi);

If there is a DeFi swap, the function _defiSwap(wallet, defi) is called

                uint256 fBalance = ERC20(ss.origin).balanceOf(wallet);

After performing the DeFi swap this line captures the final balance of ss.origin token after the swap. The idea is to check how the balance has changed as a result of the operation


                if (fBalance - iBalance != 0) ss.oAmount = fBalance - iBalance;


This line calculates the difference between the final balance (fBalance) and the initial balance (iBalance). This difference represents the amount of tokens spent or received due to the DeFi swap

                 if (fBalance - iBalance != 0) ss.oAmount = fBalance - iBalance;

If the balance has changed (i.e., fBalance - iBalance != 0), it adjusts the amount. The oAmount represents the current balance of the wallet

however when  the swap is performed

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-telcoin/blob/main/telcoin-audit/contracts/swap/AmirX.sol#L166-L172


the f balance after (increase in balance) is not updated or accounted for the amount recieved is never updated
meaning the f balance and i balance will remain the same if which will trigger this line (fBalance - iBalance != 0) as a result the balance of the wallet will be wrong it wont reflect the true amount wallet received leading to wrong balance update

### External pre-conditions

### Attack Path

not an attack

### Impact

loss of funds for the wallet owner

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

when swap is executed check the amount received from swap and update the f balance
