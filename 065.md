# Swapper still pay fee for referrer when call `swap()` function even token not swapped, under certain conditions

### Summary

Swapper still pay fee for referrer  when call `swap()` function even token not swapped, under certain conditions. The conditions are that token origin must be `stablecoin`,  `directional` must be `true` , `stablecoinSwap.destination` must be `address(0)` and there must be a referrer (& fee).

Note

Based on contest `README` : 

> The contract is constructed so that most inputs can be ignored in nearly any flow unless this would lead to a loss of funds
> 

The impact of this issue is a loss for the swapper because they still have to pay a fee for the referrer even though the token is not swapped, this is an issue.

### Root Cause

*In [AmirX.sol : 80 - 85](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-telcoin/blob/main/telcoin-audit/contracts/swap/AmirX.sol#L80-L85) there is an error in the validation logic*

*This can happen because there is no validation whether the origin token is a regular ERC20 or a stablecoin and the function does not revert if the swap does not occur.*

### Internal pre-conditions

- token origin = `stablecoin`
- `directional` = `true`
- `stablecoinSwap.destination` must be `address(0)`
- there is must be a referrer with fee

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

Swapper role call the swap function and because there is error in validation logic the function succeeds but the token is not swapped (the token failed to be swapped but the function did not fail) then the swapper still has to pay a fee to the referrer

### Impact

1. Swapper still pay fee for referrer when call `swap()` function even token not swapped
2. If the swapper repeats the swap, the referrer will get the fee twice

Note
This issue can occur in any type of `defiSwap` function model

### PoC

Test specs :

```solidity
stablecoinInputs = 
      liquiditySafe: deployer,
      destination: ZERO_ADDRESS, // condition for this issue to occur
      origin: eUSD, // condition for this issue to occur
      oAmount: 10,
      target: eMXN, // condition for this issue to occur
      tAmount: 100,
      stablecoinFeeCurrency: eUSD,
      stablecoinFeeSafe: safe.address,
      feeAmount: 5
 
 defiInputs = 
      defiSafe: deployer,
      aggregator: aggregator,
      plugin: plugin,
      feeToken: await telcoin.getAddress(),
      referrer: deployer, // condition for this issue to occur
      referralFee: 10, // condition for this issue to occur
      walletData: '0x', 
      swapData: await aggregator.getSwapSelector(),
```

Ending eUSD Total Supply : 15n 
Ending eUSD Balance of Safe : 0n 
Ending eMXN Balance of Holder : 0n 
Ending telcoin Balance of plugin : 10n // this show no swapped happened but swapper still pay fee to referrer
        ✔ swapper still pay for referrer even token not swapped (72ms)

  1 passing (4s)
