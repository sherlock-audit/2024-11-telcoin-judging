# Strict minting & burning functionality may stop execution of StablecoinSwap

### Summary

See the root cause section. 

### Root Cause

Strict access control in `Stablecoin::mintTo()` & `Stablecoin::burnFrom()` may lead to issue. We can see that the mintTo() is only callable by MINTER_ROLE & burnFrom() only callable by BURNER_ROLE. 
In StablecoinHandler(), during StablecoinSwap, minTo() & burnFrom() is called from `_stablecoinSwap()`. From this we can understand that MINTER_ROLE & BURNER_ROLE must be assigned to the AmirX contract [ since StablecoinHandler is an abstract function & AmirX was inherited from it ]. If AmirX has those 2 role then no other address can call mintTo() & burnFrom(). This can create problem because in stablecoinSwap origin token is burned & target token is minted. A token can only be burned if it was minted before. As the mintTo() only callable by AmirX & AmirX calls the minTo() only during swap, after burning another token, it falls into a broken phase like the to be burned token has not minted yet. In a nutshell we can say that the minting process is only initiate after burning an another token & limited only that place.  So if the very first swap is StablecoinSwap [ by calling stablecoinSwap() ] then it may revert.

**Example:**
Alice want to swap 100 eMXN to 100 eUSD where both are stablecoin in terms of Telcoin protocol i.e both are deployed using Stablecoin contract. Now to have 100 eMXN in Alice's account that amount of eMXN must be minted to Alice. The issue is here, it is not possible to mint eMXN externally to Alice, only 1 way to mint is calling stablecoinSwap(), but this won't work because this function will attempt to burn 100 eMXN from Alice's account but Alice do not have eMXN yet. We can say the minting process is locked in stablecoinSwap().

The tests in StablecoinHandler.test.ts are passing because the tokens are minted externally to the wallet:
```js
it("stablecoinSwap", async () => {
                await eUSD.mintTo(holder, 15);      // @audit origin token were minted to wallet externally
                const inputs = {
                    liquiditySafe: deployer,
                    destination: holder,
                    origin: eUSD,
                    oAmount: 10,
                    target: eMXN,
                    tAmount: 100,
                    stablecoinFeeCurrency: eUSD,
                    stablecoinFeeSafe: safe.address,
                    feeAmount: 5
                }

                await eUSD.connect(holder).approve(stablecoinHandler, 15);
                await expect(stablecoinHandler.stablecoinSwap(holder, inputs)).to.not.be.reverted;
                expect(await eUSD.totalSupply()).to.equal(5);
                expect(await eUSD.balanceOf(safe)).to.equal(5);
                expect(await eMXN.balanceOf(holder)).to.equal(100);
            });
```
But in production it is not possible to mint externally due to role restriction.

### Mitigation

Do not limit the minting only in stablecoinSwap().
