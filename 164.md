# Lack of data validation in SWAP and defiToStablecoinSwap function can lead to a bypass of the minimum total Supply check

### Summary

A vulnerability in the `swap` and `defiToStablecoinSwap` functions allows bypassing the minimum total supply check due to inadequate validation of `ss.oAmount`. This could lead to a situation where the total token supply drops below the required minimum limit

### Root Cause

The `defiToStablecoinSwap` function does not validate `ss.oAmount` after a defi swap, which introduces the following issues:
   - **Inconsistent `ss.oAmount` Value:** The value of `ss.oAmount` may differ after a defi swap, potentially bypassing the stablecoin swap verification checks.
   - **Minimum Supply Violation:** Without re-verifying `ss.oAmount` after it is recalculated post-defi swap, the contract may burn tokens below the established minimum supply threshold, contravening the protocolâ€™s constraints.

The critical section of the code, as shown below, illustrates how `ss.oAmount` is set after a defi swap without re-verifying:

****Admin** can never accurately predict the amount out hence ss Amount may very after the defiswap**

  ```solidity
   function swap(
        address wallet,
        bool directional,
        StablecoinSwap memory ss,
        DefiSwap memory defi
    ) external payable onlyRole(SWAPPER_ROLE) whenNotPaused {
        // checks if it will fail
        if (ss.destination != address(0)) _verifyStablecoinSwap(wallet, ss);
        if (defi.walletData.length != 0) _verifyDefiSwap(wallet, defi);

        if (directional) {
            // if only defi swap
            if (ss.destination == address(0)) _defiSwap(wallet, defi);
            else {
                // if defi then stablecoin swap
                //check balance to adjust second swap
                uint256 iBalance = ERC20(ss.origin).balanceOf(wallet);
                if (defi.walletData.length != 0) _defiSwap(wallet, defi);
                uint256 fBalance = ERC20(ss.origin).balanceOf(wallet);
                //change balance to reflect change

 @audit>> >>        if (fBalance - iBalance != 0)      @audit>> unverified >>  ss.oAmount = fBalance - iBalance;
              
@audit>>   _stablecoinSwap(wallet, ss);
            }
  ```
   ```solidity
   uint256 iBalance = ERC20(ss.origin).balanceOf(wallet);
   _defiSwap(wallet, defi);
   uint256 fBalance = ERC20(ss.origin).balanceOf(wallet);
 
@audit>> unverified >>  ss.oAmount = fBalance - iBalance;

@audit>>    _stablecoinSwap(wallet, ss);
   ```

The current setup checks for minimum supply limits only during `_verifyStablecoinSwap`. Without re-verifying `ss.oAmount` after recalculation, the protocol may burn tokens beyond safe limits. For instance:

   ```solidity
@audit>>      if (Stablecoin(ss.origin).totalSupply() - ss.oAmount < getMinLimit(ss.origin)) {
       revert InvalidMintBurnBoundary(ss.origin, ss.oAmount);
   }
   ```
This lack of verification means the transaction could proceed with an adjusted `ss.oAmount` that violates supply constraints, resulting in unintended depletion of token supply and contravening protocol rules as specified in the README: **"Tokens that spend off fee portions should be allowed, and if a portion of the fee sent off breaks the contract, then this would be an issue."**

### External pre-conditions

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

The primary impact of this vulnerability includes:
   - **Breaking Minimum Supply Limits:** When `ss.oAmount` changes without verification, it may bypass supply boundaries, potentially leading to excessive burns and destabilizing the token supply.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

To mitigate this vulnerability, additional validation steps should be implemented after recalculating `ss.oAmount`. The following changes are suggested:

1. **Add Verification Post Defi Swap:** Re-run `_verifyStablecoinSwap` with the recalculated `ss.oAmount` to ensure the value remains within safe boundaries.
