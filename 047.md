# Users pay fees for failed transactions.

### Summary

 The fee-first collection pattern in `StablecoinHandler `causes users to lose fees when subsequent swap operations fail, as fees are collected before validating the complete transaction path.

### Root Cause

- In `StablecoinHandler`.sol, the [_stablecoinSwap ](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-telcoin/blob/main/telcoin-audit/contracts/stablecoin/StablecoinHandler.sol#L144) function collects fees before executing the main swap operation:


### Internal pre-conditions

Since the fee is transferred first, a failure in any subsequent transfer would result in:

1. Fee already collected by protocol
2. User loses fee amount
3. Main swap operation not completed
4. No automatic fee refund mechanism

- This creates a scenario where users pay fees for failed transactions.


### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

- User initiates swap with valid parameters
- Protocol collects fee successfully
- Main swap operation encounters failure.
- Transaction reverts
- Fee remains collected despite failed service

### Impact

Users lose fee amounts while receiving no service.
