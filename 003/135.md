# No Check for Contract's TELCOIN Balance Before Approving Referral Fee

### Summary

In `_feeDispersal`, the `AmirX` contract does not verify its TELCOIN balance before approving the `defi.referralFee`. This oversight may cause swap transactions to fail if the balance is insufficient to cover the required referral fee, resulting transaction reverts & DOS.

### Root Cause

In [AmirX.sol: 196](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-telcoin/blob/b9c751b59e78a7123a636e31ecafc9147046f190/telcoin-audit/contracts/swap/AmirX.sol#L196), the `_feeDispersal` function proceeds to approve and increase the allowance for `defi.plugin` without first verifying that the contract holds enough TELCOIN to cover `defi.referralFee`.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. The contract’s TELCOIN balance is less than `defi.referralFee`.
2. A swap operation triggers `_feeDispersal`.

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. The `SWAPPER_ROLE` initiates a swap requiring a referral fee to be paid out.
2. `_feeDispersal` attempts to approve and increase the allowance for `defi.plugin` to facilitate the referral fee.
3. If the contract’s TELCOIN balance is insufficient, the approval process fails, causing the transaction to revert.

### Impact

Swap transactions fail due to insufficient funds for the referral fee, leading to a denial of service for users who are expecting referral rewards.



### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

To prevent failures, check the contract’s TELCOIN balance before approving and increasing the allowance. If the balance is insufficient, handle it gracefully by adjusting the referral fee amount accordingly or notifying the user.
