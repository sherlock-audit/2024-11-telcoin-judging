# Potential Misuse of `defi.referralFee` in `_feeDispersal` Leading to Transaction Reverts

### Summary

In the `AmirX` contract, if `defi.referralFee` is set higher than the contract's current TELCOIN balance, `_feeDispersal` may attempt to allocate more TELCOIN than available. This could cause the `increaseClaimableBy` call to fail, resulting in a transaction revert and denial of service for users.

### Root Cause

In [AmirX.sol: 194](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-telcoin/blob/b9c751b59e78a7123a636e31ecafc9147046f190/telcoin-audit/contracts/swap/AmirX.sol#L194), `_feeDispersal` does not verify that the contract has a sufficient TELCOIN balance before attempting to allocate `defi.referralFee` to `defi.plugin`. Although `safeIncreaseAllowance` will succeed, `increaseClaimableBy` may fail due to insufficient funds.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. `defi.referralFee` is set higher than the TELCOIN balance held by the contract.
2. A swap or similar transaction triggers `_feeDispersal`.

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. The `SWAPPER_ROLE` initiates a transaction that triggers `_feeDispersal` and sets `defi.referralFee` higher than the contractâ€™s current TELCOIN balance.
2. `_feeDispersal` successfully calls `safeIncreaseAllowance`, enabling the contract to authorize the `defi.referralFee`.
However, due to insufficient TELCOIN balance, the subsequent `increaseClaimableBy` call fails, causing the entire transaction to revert.

### Impact

Transactions requiring referral fee payouts may revert unexpectedly, causing a denial of service for users expecting smooth transaction processing.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Add a balance check before initiating the referral fee allocation process in `_feeDispersal`. Ensure that the contract's TELCOIN balance can fully cover `defi.referralFee` before proceeding.
