# The internal functions `_onceBlacklisted` and `_update` remain inaccessible within the protocol.

### Summary

The internal functions `_onceBlacklisted` and `_update` in `stablecoin.sol` are defined but never called, making them ineffective in managing blacklisted accounts. As a result, funds become permanently locked for blacklisted users, preventing any transfers between accounts.

### Root Cause

- _onceBlacklisted: This function, intended to transfer the balance of a blacklisted account, is internal but never called, leaving blacklisted users’ funds irretrievable.
- _update: This function checks for blacklisted accounts on transfers but is also never called, preventing blacklist checks from taking effect on transfers and transfer.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. The _onceBlacklisted and _update functions are defined in stablecoin.sol but are never invoked within the protocol.
2. Blacklisted accounts exist and are unable to perform transfers or retrieve funds due to the inaccessible functions.

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

These functions are unused and inaccessible; blacklisted funds cannot be transferred or recovered by the protocol, resulting in permanent loss of access to their balance.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Integrate `_onceBlacklisted` and `_update` within the protocol’s workflow to ensure proper handling of blacklisted accounts and transfering funds between accounts
