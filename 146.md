# Incorrect value in the calculation for the `ss.oAmount` is not handled correctly.

### Summary

In the `AmiriX::swap` and the `AmiriX::defiToStablecoinSwap` function an estimate of `ss.oAmount` is initially passed in, then after the defi swap occurs the actual value sent in is then used as the `ss.oAmount`. In the `AmiriX::swap` function if the   `fBalance - iBalance == 0`, the initial value(which is non-zero) is used. While in the `AmiriX::defiToStablecoinSwap` function the `ss.Amount == fBalance - iBalance`.

### Root Cause

In [`Amirix#L125`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-telcoin/blob/main/telcoin-audit/contracts/swap/AmirX.sol#L125) and [`AmiriX#L93`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-telcoin/blob/main/telcoin-audit/contracts/swap/AmirX.sol#L93) the transaction does not revert if `fBalance - iBalance == 0` (which means the origin token wasn't sent to the wallet).

### Attack Path


### Impact

If no tokens are gotten from the defi swap the `ss.oAmount` will be 0 but the transaction will not be reverted and the `ss.tAmount` of the target currency will be minted to the destination.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Ensure the transaction reverts if no tokens are sent during the defi swap.
