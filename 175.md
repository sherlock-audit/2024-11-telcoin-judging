# Tokens can be lost if any user is blacklisted

## Summary

It is stated in the Telcoin intro that the protocol will only accept vetted tokens such as `USDC`, `USDT`.

Yet by using these popular tokens such as `USDC`, there exists a case where the tokens for every user will be locked permanently. This is due to the blacklist system which is implemented by `USDC` and many other popular well-reputed tokens.

In `Stablecoin.sol`, if any of the users is blacklisted (due to illegal activities, using Tornado Cash for privacy reasons, spite by one of the participants), the funds for every participant will be locked permanently.

## Vulnerability Details

Reference/Affected code:

In the `Stablecoin.sol` contract, when mint function is created,  the one way to mint the token is by:

Minting `value` tokens to the caller's account whereby , only accounts with MINTER_ROLE can call this function and also the amount of tokens to mint.

Then we have the erc20rescue function with token where currency stuck in contract ,the destination address where funds are returned and  the amount been transferred.
     
If one of the user's address that is set to receive funds is blacklisted however, the functions will revert and essentially "brick" the contract, making it impossible to ever recover the funds.

Blacklisting is certainly not uncommon and is used many of the popular token used for payments, such as the stablecoin `USDC`. An address can get blacklisted for illegal activities, some were blacklisted for just using tools like `Tornado Cash` to keep their transactions private and it is also perfectly possible for a disgruntled user to intentionally blacklist his address to block the withdrawal of funds.

Essentially, if **any of the addresses involved is blacklisted, none of the user can receive their funds**.

We have included a POC to showcase how it works in all the cases. You can get the POC file in the following gist: <https://gist.github.com/TheNaubit/b0cc2e6b4d1ae2bea637d9d89d9b5b19>

To run it, has paste the content of the gist inside a file called `WithdrawFailBlacklisted.t.sol` inside the `test` folder in the project. Then run them with the following command:

``
forge test --match-contract WithdrawFailBlacklisted


## Impact

When this issue happens, all the funds in the contract are locked forever making every user to lose their funds.

## Recommendations

There are one solution with two parts:

1. Instead of trying to transfer the funds to each address, store in a state variable how many funds each address can withdraw and then create a `withdraw` function only callable when the minting is finished where each user can withdraw the funds they own. In this case, if any participant is blacklisted, at least the rest will be able to get the rest of the funds.

2. The second part of the solution is to solve the part of some participant not being able to withdraw if they are blacklisted. A solution would be to implement a function to allow each user to set another withdrawal address for their funds, so even if they are blacklisted, they can at least withdraw those funds to another address.
