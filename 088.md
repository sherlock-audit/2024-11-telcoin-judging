# Fee-on-Transfer Token Loss in Stablecoin Swap Implementation Due to Avoidable Additional Transfer

### Summary

An inefficient fee collection mechanism will cause excess fee-on-transfer losses for users as they must first transfer the fee amount to the wallet before the swap, when it could be deducted from the swap amount directly.


### Root Cause

In StablecoinHandler.sol:_stablecoinSwap() at https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-telcoin/blob/main/telcoin-audit/contracts/stablecoin/StablecoinHandler.sol#L152  the stablecoin fee is collected via a separate transfer from the user via wallet. This is evident as the fee is transferred first, even before the swap is performed.
```solidity
if (ss.stablecoinFeeCurrency != address(0) && ss.stablecoinFeeSafe != address(0)) {
    ERC20PermitUpgradeable(ss.stablecoinFeeCurrency).safeTransferFrom(
        wallet,
        ss.stablecoinFeeSafe,
        ss.feeAmount
    );
}
```
Instead of deducting it from the swap amount when the fee currency matches the target token.

### Attack Path

Consider USDT with 1% fee on transfer:

User wants to swap 1000 USDe to USDT with 10 USDT telcoin swap fee
Current flow:
a. User must first transfer 10 USDT fee
   - User transfers 10.1 USDT to cover fee-on-transfer
   - After 1% fee, wallet receives 10 USDT
   - Send 10 USDT fee to safe.

b. Then swap executes
   - 1000 USDe is taken from user via wallet.
   - 1000 USDT is sent from liquiditySafe to destination.  After 1% fee, destination receives 990 USDT. Net receive 990-10.1 (paid for fee)= 979.9.

What should happen:
a. User provides 1000 USDe
b. Single swap execution:
   - 1000 USDe taken from user
   - 1000 USDT sent from liquiditySafe
   - Send 10 USDT as fee to safe.
   - Remaining 990 to user. User receives 980.1 after transfer fee.


Please note transfer fee on wallet to safe remain in both the cases.

But overall user has a loss due to additional transfer required at the start for fee as well as same amount being returned to the user.


### Impact

The users suffer an unnecessary loss due to an extra fee-on-transfer deduction on the fee amount
