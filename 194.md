# The `BURNER` cannot burn tokens from blacklisted accounts due to the check in `_update`

### Summary

The `BURNER_ROLE` cannot burn tokens if the target account has been blacklisted.
The `BURNER_ROLE` should have the capability to burn tokens of any account, even if the account is blacklisted. 
However, there is a check that prevents that.

### Root Cause

In the `Stablecoin` contract, both `burn` and `burnFrom` functions call the `_burn` function which calls [_update](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-telcoin/blob/main/telcoin-audit/contracts/stablecoin/Stablecoin.sol#L127-L136).

```solidity
function _update(
        address from,
        address to,
        uint256 value
    ) internal override {
        if (blacklisted(from)) revert Blacklisted(from);
        if (blacklisted(to)) revert Blacklisted(to);

        super._update(from, to, value);
    }
```
As you can see, `_update` overrides the base implementation and includes two checks,
which are the reason that burning from blacklisted accounts will not be possible.

### External pre-conditions

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

The `BURNER_ROLE` cannot burn tokens if the target account has been blacklisted.
This will practically DoS the burning functionality for a user who has been blacklisted,
but there are tokens to be burned from him.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Allow the `BURNER` to burn tokens without checking if the address has been blacklisted.
