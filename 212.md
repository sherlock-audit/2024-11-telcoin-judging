# More than, deposited stable tokens will be minted during the directional swap, for fee on transfer tokens.

### Summary

The value given by the 'SWAPPER_ROLE' of `ss.oAmount` is getting overriden in the function `AmirX::swap()` which is making the user to earn more tokens then the amount of tokens deposited in case of fee on transfer type tokens.

### Root Cause

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-telcoin/blob/main/telcoin-audit/contracts/swap/AmirX.sol#L93

### Internal pre-conditions

NA

### External pre-conditions

Token should be of type fee on transfer.

### Attack Path

Let's take a scenario where user have `AAVE` of amount `1000`. So has to first swap it USDT which is fee on transfer of 10%(It is not just for assumption here ) and 1 AAVE = 2 USDT, Now user has to convert those `AAVE` to tUSDT(Telcoin type of stable coin), so for `stableCoinSwap` `ss.oAmount = 2000`,  and `ss.tAmount = 1800` as 10 percent fee.  
1. User will submit the transaction with given data off chain and the user with `SWAPPER_ROLE`, executes the transaction with the given data.  
2. So here `ss.origin` will be `USDT` , let's take current wallet balance of the user in `USDT` is 0(iBalance= 0) and the transaction will be directional.  
3. Now `_defiSwap()` function executes and user gets `USDT = 1800`(200 FEE). Now `ss.oAmount = 1800` value given by the `SWAPPER_ROLE` has been overriden.  
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-telcoin/blob/main/telcoin-audit/contracts/swap/AmirX.sol#L89-L93  
5. Now `_stablecoinSwap(wallet, ss);` function begins to convert `USDT` to `tUSDT`.  
6. `ss.oAmount = 1800` and that amount of `USDT` will be sent to the `liquiditySafe` and `liquiditySafe` will receive `1800 - 10 % of 1800 = 1620`  
7. But the minted amount of `tUSDT` to the user will be equal to `ss.tAmount` which is `1800` here , hence the user has deposited less token and gained more token than intended.(Not included 10% extra fee)



### Impact

* User will be able to mint more than intended stable tokens.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

* The `ss.tAmount` should also be updated according to `ss.oAmount`.
