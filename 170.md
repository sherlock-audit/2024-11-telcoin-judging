# In `AmirX.sol` the `defiToStablecoinSwap` function the user might receive a lot less funds than expected

### Summary

In [AmirX.sol](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-telcoin/blob/main/telcoin-audit/contracts/swap/AmirX.sol) contract the  function [defiToStableCoinSwap](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-telcoin/blob/main/telcoin-audit/contracts/swap/AmirX.sol#L111) performs a `defiSwap` [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-telcoin/blob/main/telcoin-audit/contracts/swap/AmirX.sol#L123) which is followed by a `stableCoinSwap` [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-telcoin/blob/main/telcoin-audit/contracts/swap/AmirX.sol#L127) in the end. After checking the validating the params in the structs. [It checks initial balance of the ss.origin](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-telcoin/blob/main/telcoin-audit/contracts/swap/AmirX.sol#L122)  then it performs a `_defiSwap`. Then it checks the [finalBalance of the ss.origin](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-telcoin/blob/main/telcoin-audit/contracts/swap/AmirX.sol#L124). The issue  that'll arise here is that before performing the `_stableSwap` it takes [difference between the fBalance and the iBalance as ss.origin](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-telcoin/blob/main/telcoin-audit/contracts/swap/AmirX.sol#L125) and performs the `_stableCoinSwap` with this amount.
The flow of the function will be like - ` AAVE -> USDC -> eUSD` this indicates that first the defiSwap then the stableSwap will take place. In the issue if the token is FoT then the target tokens that'll be received will more less and then too there will be fees also included in `stableCoinSwap` which will be taken out from the walet.
Note that even if there are slippage checks in the aggregator or router contracts, The transaction then will mostly revert.

### Root Cause

Takes difference between the `finalBalance and the initialBalance` for the ending `stableCoinSwap`

### Internal pre-conditions

The SWAPPER must have a preset value of lets say 1000 USDC.

### External pre-conditions

the SWAPPER calls the function with preset balance of 1000 USDC as `ss.origin` in the wallet

### Attack Path

Lets take a scenario where SWAPPER makes a swap of AAVE -> USDC -> eUSD.
SWAPPER calls the `defiToStableCoinSwap` function with 1000 USDC (ss.origin) in his wallet.
the iBalance will be = 1000
then the `_defiSwap` will be called with AAVE -> USDC. Lets say he gets 200 USDC for 100 AAVE 
After this the fBalance will be  = 1200 USDC
Then ` ss.oAmount = fBalance - iBalance;` = 1200 - 1000 = 200 USDC
then the `_stableCoinSwap` will be called with swapping only 200 to the target token(eUSD)

This clearly shows that end target token received is indeed very less than the user would expect to get as the target token. Note that this amount will reduce more in case of Fee on Transfer Tokens and also including the fees which taken for the `_stableCoinSwap`

### Impact

The user will receive less `target` than he expected

### PoC

See Attack Path and;

```solidity
 //check balance to adjust second swap
        uint256 iBalance = ERC20(ss.origin).balanceOf(wallet); //1000 USDC
        _defiSwap(wallet, defi); // AAVE -> USDC = 100 AAVE-> 200 USDC
        uint256 fBalance = ERC20(ss.origin).balanceOf(wallet); //1200 USDC
     //AUDIT->   ss.oAmount = fBalance - iBalance; // 1200 - 1000 = 200
        //change balance to reflect change
        _stablecoinSwap(wallet, ss); //it'll swap 200 USDC -> 200 eUSD (Note: there will also be issues here if FoT are included)
    }
    ```

### Mitigation

Recommendation will be that instead of taking the difffernce b/w the `fBalance and the iBalance` `_stableCoinSwap` should be called directly after the defiSwap.

```solidity
   //check balance to adjust second swap
        uint256 iBalance = ERC20(ss.origin).balanceOf(wallet);
        _defiSwap(wallet, defi);
        uint256 fBalance = ERC20(ss.origin).balanceOf(wallet);

    ->   ss.oAmount = fBalance - iBalance;

        //change balance to reflect change
        _stablecoinSwap(wallet, ss);
    }
    ```
