# Fee handling vulnerability allows fee bypass in swap operations

### Summary

The fee handling mechanism in AmirX contract has a vulnerability where fees can be manipulated or bypassed due to insufficient validation of fee parameters and potential race conditions in the fee dispersal process.

### Root Cause

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-telcoin/blob/main/telcoin-audit/contracts/swap/AmirX.sol#L183-L214
The _feeDispersal function lacks proper validation of fee amounts and relies on external calls without proper checks on return values or state changes. Additionally, the fee token approval mechanism could be exploited

### Internal pre-conditions

1. A swap operation must be initiated
2. DefiSwap struct must include fee parameters
3. Fee token must be different from TELCOIN

### External pre-conditions

Aggregator contract must exist and be callable

### Attack Path

1. Attacker constructs a DefiSwap struct with:
      - Minimal referral fee
      - Carefully crafted swapData
2. Exploit the token approval reset to potentially manipulate fee payments
3. Use front-running to take advantage of the state changes

### Impact

Potential loss of protocol fees
Manipulation of referral rewards

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Add fee validation checks before swap execution
