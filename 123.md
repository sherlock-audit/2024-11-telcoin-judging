# Fee on transfer tokens could make receiver receive less token that should be when swapping

### Summary

Fee on transfer (e.g `STA`, `PAXG`, `USDC`, `USDT`) tokens could make receiver receive less token that should be

Based on contest `README` :

> Tokens that spend off fee portions should be allowed, and if a portion of the fee sent off breaks the contract, than this would be an issue
> 

When the `swapper` calls the `stablecoinSwap()` function then `stablecoinFeeCurrency` ,  `stablecoinFeeSafe` are given and also with the amount of the fee, this will be problematic if the fee on transfer is used as a `stablecoin` and not recognize with `isXYZ()` function because as the name suggests, the fee on transfer has its own fee when making a transfer. 

Now we will see logic if `FoT` token used for origin token / target token and fee token :

```solidity
function _stablecoinSwap(
        address wallet,
        StablecoinSwap memory ss
    ) internal {
        if (
            ss.stablecoinFeeCurrency != address(0) &&
            ss.stablecoinFeeSafe != address(0)
        )
            ERC20PermitUpgradeable(ss.stablecoinFeeCurrency).safeTransferFrom(
                wallet,
                ss.stablecoinFeeSafe,
                ss.feeAmount
            );

        // Handle the transfer or burning of the origin currency:
        // If the origin is a recognized stablecoin (XYZ), burn the specified amount from the wallet.
        if (isXYZ(ss.origin)) {
            Stablecoin(ss.origin).burnFrom(wallet, ss.oAmount);
        } else {
            ERC20PermitUpgradeable(ss.origin).safeTransferFrom(
                wallet,
                ss.liquiditySafe,
                ss.oAmount
            );
        }

        // Handle the minting or transferring of the target currency:
        // If the target is a recognized stablecoin (XYZ), mint the required amount to the destination address.
        if (isXYZ(ss.target)) {
            Stablecoin(ss.target).mintTo(ss.destination, ss.tAmount);
        } else {
            ERC20PermitUpgradeable(ss.target).safeTransferFrom(
                ss.liquiditySafe,
                ss.destination,
                ss.tAmount
            );
        }
    }
```

The amount that will be receive for receiver in this case `ss.stablecoinFeeSafe`, `ss.liquiditySafe` and `ss.destination` less than should be because transfer.

As an example :

Alice want to swap `eUSD` as `ss.origin`, `isXYZ() = true`, and with `amount = 100`.

Alice want to swap for `STA` as `ss.target`, `isXYZ = false`.

let say the rate 1 : 1. 

Alice will receiver less than 100 because `STA` is `FoT` token and it transfer from `liquiditySafe` (transfer will use fee) to Alice address.

### Root Cause

*In [StablecoinHandler.sol : 144 - 181](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-telcoin/blob/main/telcoin-audit/contracts/stablecoin/StablecoinHandler.sol#L144-L181) there are logic make receiver (swapper and* `stablecoinFeeSafe`) receiver less token

Note

Based on contest `README` :

```solidity
However issues raised simply stating "user's might get less than expected" is not valid if the source of this issue is simply lacking checks for return values
```

This is not just an issue about measuring the return value of a transfer, but this issue exists because there are too many transfer mechanisms from each point to the destination address
