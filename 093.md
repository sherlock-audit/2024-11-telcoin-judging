# `Stablecoin.erc20Rescue` will bypass blacklist restrictions when rescuing standard tokens to blacklisted addresses

### Summary

The missing blacklist validation in `Stablecoin.erc20Rescue` function will cause a violation of blacklist restrictions for the `Stablecoin` contract as `SUPPORT_ROLE` holders will be able to transfer standard tokens to blacklisted addresses using the `Stablecoin.erc20Rescue` function, effectively bypassing the blacklist validation that exists in stablecoin transfers

### Root Cause

In [`contracts/stablecoin/Stablecoin.sol:154`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-telcoin/blob/main/telcoin-audit/contracts/stablecoin/Stablecoin.sol#L154) the `Stablecoin.erc20Rescue` function lacks blacklist validation for the destination address. While the contract enforces blacklist restrictions in the `Blacklist._update` function for stablecoin transfers, the `Stablecoin.erc20Rescue` function can be used to bypass these restrictions for standard token transfers. This creates an inconsistency with the contract's core blacklist functionality which is meant to prevent any token transfers involving blacklisted addresses. 

### Internal pre-conditions

1. A `SUPPORT_ROLE` holder needs to exist in the system to use `Stablecoin.erc20Rescue`
2. A user address needs to be blacklisted via `Blacklist.addBlackList`
3. The `Stablecoin` contract needs to have some standard tokens that belong to the blacklisted user or were meant to be rescued

### External pre-conditions

None required as this is entirely contained within the protocol's control

### Attack Path

1. A user gets blacklisted through `Blacklist.addBlackList`
2. Some standard tokens end up in the `Stablecoin` contract (either through direct transfer or other means)
3. The `SUPPORT_ROLE` holder calls `Stablecoin.erc20Rescue` with the following parameters:
    - `token`: The token address to be rescued
    - `destination`: The blacklisted user's address
    - `amount`: The amount to be transferred
4. The tokens are successfully transferred to the blacklisted address, bypassing the blacklist restrictions that are enforced in `Stablecoin._update` for stablecoin

### Impact

The protocol suffers a security control bypass as blacklisted addresses, which are supposed to be completely restricted from receiving tokens, can still receive them through `Stablecoin.erc20Rescue`. This undermines the blacklisting mechanism which appears to be a core security feature of the protocol, potentially compromising compliance and regulatory requirements. While this requires `SUPPORT_ROLE` access, it creates an inconsistency in blacklist enforcement that could be exploited intentionally or accidentally.

### PoC


### Mitigation

Add blacklist validation to the `Stablecoin.erc20Rescue` function:
```solidity
function erc20Rescue(
    ERC20PermitUpgradeable token,
    address destination,
    uint256 amount
) external onlyRole(SUPPORT_ROLE) {
    // Add blacklist check for destination
    if (blacklisted(destination)) revert Blacklisted(destination);
    
    token.safeTransfer(destination, amount);
}
```
