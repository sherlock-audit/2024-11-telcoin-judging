# StablecoinHandler may experience storage collisions affecting token decimals

### Summary

The Stablecoin.sol contract uses a custom storage slot (DECIMALS_SLOT) to store the decimals value. This will cause inconsistencies in token calculations for users as the storage layout may collide with other contracts in an upgradeable proxy setup, leading to corrupted decimals values.

### Root Cause

 In Stablecoin.sol at lines https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-telcoin/blob/main/telcoin-audit/contracts/stablecoin/Stablecoin.sol#L62 , a custom storage slot is defined and used to store the decimals value, potentially overlapping with other storage variables in an upgradeable proxy environment.


### Internal pre-conditions


1. The contract is deployed behind a proxy.


2. Another contract in the same proxy ecosystem uses the same or overlapping storage slots.



### External pre-conditions


1. An upgrade is performed on the proxy that alters storage layouts without preserving slot uniqueness.


2. External contracts interact with the proxy, possibly causing unintended state modifications

### Attack Path


1. During an upgrade, the new implementation inadvertently uses the same storage slot for different variables.


2. This collision corrupts the decimals value, leading to incorrect token behavior.


3. Users experience miscalculations in token transfers and balances, resulting in financial discrepancies.



### Impact

Token calculations become unreliable, leading to potential financial losses and undermining user trust in the token's stability.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Adopt Standard Storage Patterns: Utilize OpenZeppelin's standardized storage layouts for upgradeable contracts to prevent slot collisions.

Thorough Upgrade Testing: Before deploying upgrades, rigorously test storage layouts to ensure no overlaps occur.

Comprehensive Documentation: Maintain detailed documentation of all storage slots used across contracts to aid in preventing collisions during future developments.
