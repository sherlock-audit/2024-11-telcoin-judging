# If Fee token would be Buy Token, then StableCoinSwap will revert

### Summary

In StableCoinSwap, in codebase  feetoken is being transfered to safe first and then buyToken is being minted to user.
So there can be case in both defiToStable and normal stablecoinswap that, feetoken will not be there with user in stablecoin swap if fee token would be buy token or lets say Target Token. then it would revert as low balance would be there in wallet

### Root Cause

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-telcoin/blob/main/telcoin-audit/contracts/stablecoin/StablecoinHandler.sol#L144C4-L181C6

in both the case lets say there can be the case, in defitoSablecoin swap and in direct stable coin swap.

in user will swap AAve --> usdc --> eMXn 

And if fee token would be eMxn , then in stableCoinSwap eMxn would not be minted to user before , as fee token would be transfered first and it would not be there with user as it i being minted later

### External pre-conditions

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

both functions could revert due to minting of token is done after fee token is transfered

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

FeeToken means target token should be minted first and then fee should be supplied to feeSafe.
