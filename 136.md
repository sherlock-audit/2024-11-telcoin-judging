# Lack of Slippage Protection in defiToStablecoinSwap Function

### Summary

The `defiToStablecoinSwap` function does not include any slippage protection, making it vulnerable to price fluctuations between the time the swap is initiated and the time it is completed. When performing token swaps, especially with volatile assets, slippage can result in a significant difference between the expected amount and the actual amount received, leading to unfavorable trade outcomes for users. This function executes a two-step swap: first from DeFi tokens to stablecoins and then from stablecoins to another asset. If the price of the assets changes during this process, users could be exposed to unexpected losses or inefficiencies.

### Impact

Without slippage protection, users may face the following risks:

- Unexpected losses: If the price of tokens changes between the two swap steps, the final amount of stablecoins or the target asset may differ significantly from what the user expected, leading to a financial loss.
- Decreased user trust: Inconsistent swap outcomes due to slippage may result in users feeling unsafe or dissatisfied with the platform, decreasing adoption and use.

### Mitigation

To mitigate the lack of slippage protection, add slippage tolerance checks by introducing a slippageTolerance parameter.
