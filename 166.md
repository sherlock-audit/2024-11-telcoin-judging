# Functionality of `stablecoinSwap` will not work when feeToken is origin token

### Summary

- When feeToken is origin token, `stablecoinSwap` function will revert due to wrong origin amount transfer.
- For example, user wants to swap 100 USDC for 100 eUSD with `stablecoinSwap` function and feeToken is USDC.
- Now fees will be calculated from 100 USDC so lets suppose fees will be 5 USDC.
- So firstly, feeAmount will be transferFrom  wallet to stablecoinFeeSafe (i.e. 5).
```solidity
ERC20PermitUpgradeable(ss.stablecoinFeeCurrency).safeTransferFrom(
                wallet,
                ss.stablecoinFeeSafe,
                ss.feeAmount
            );
```
- After that USDC will be transferFrom wallet to liquiditySafe (i.e. oAmount).
```solidity
ERC20PermitUpgradeable(ss.origin).safeTransferFrom(
                wallet,
                ss.liquiditySafe,
                ss.oAmount
            );
```
- In this case, oAmount is 100 but wallet has only 95 USDC (100 - 5 fees).
- Because of that this function will revert and user cannot do `stablecoinSwap`.

- Also, this will happen when `defiToStablecoinSwap` is used. For example - AAVE to USDC to eUSD (10-10-10) swap, first defi swap happens and wallet will get 10 USDC and now stablecoin swap of USDC-eUSD happens in which fee transfers first and then oAmount of 10 will transfer but actually wallet will have less USDC (10-fees) so it will revert.

### Root Cause

- In `stablecoinSwap`, there is a transfer of origin token from wallet to liquiditySafe in which the amount will be oAmount but before that fees are transfered so wallet will have less balance.

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

- `stablecoinSwap` function will not work and always revert when feeToken is origin token.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

- Protocol should deduct feeAmount from oAmount while transfering origin token from wallet to liquiditySafe.
