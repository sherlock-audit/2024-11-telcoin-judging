# `StablecoinHandler::stablecoinSwap()` does not enforce price or deadline limits in `ss.oAmount` and `ss.tAmount` leading to losses in case of depeg

### Summary

[StablecoinHandler::stablecoinSwap()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-telcoin/blob/main/telcoin-audit/contracts/stablecoin/StablecoinHandler.sol#L123) swaps an `ss.oAmount` of `ss.origin` for an `ss.tAmount` of `ss.target` token. These amounts are calculated offchain and sent to `AmirX` (which inherits `StablecoinHandler`) based on the rate at the time the transaction was sent. 

However, if the `ss.origin` and `ss.target` assets value change between the amounts having been computed offchain and they are actually settle, the protocol could take major losses. Additionally, there is no deadline involved so miners can hold the transactions and wait until the price changes enough so the protocol takes a loss.

Note: `ss.feeAmount` should also have a price slippage check so the protocol is guaranteed to get a reasonable fee.

### Root Cause

In `StablecoinHandler::_verifyStablecoinSwap()`, the prices of `ss.origin` and `ss.target` tokens are not checked to confirm they more or less match the ones used when calculating the amounts offchain.  Additionally, no deadline is enforced, so the prices can vary wildly.

### Internal pre-conditions

None.

### External pre-conditions

Price between the tokens to swap, `ss.origin` and `ss.target` varies since the transaction was calculated offchain to the moment it is settled, making the protocol take a loss.

### Attack Path

1. `StablecoinHandler::stablecoinSwap::()` is called swapping 1000 USDT for 1000 eUSDC, as the rate is 1:1.
2. Before the transaction settles, USDT depegs and is worth 0.9 USD.
3. The transaction settles and 1000 USDT is swapped for 1000eUSDC, so the protocol takes a loss of 100 USD as the 1000 USDT are only worth 900 USD.

### Impact

The protocol suffers losses whenever the token sent to the `liquiditySafe` from the user loses values relatively to the token sent to the user.

### PoC

`StablecoinHandler` and `AmirX` do not check that the prices of the tokens being swapped match the ones computed offchain nor a deadline parameter.

### Mitigation

Place price slippage and deadline checks.
