# Issue with FOT stable token

### Summary


 All swaps going from defi swap to stable swap route consider FOT tax, but when the stable coin which is exetrnal applies FOT, then the swaps break

### Root Cause




if the token target is not a recognized stablecoin (XYZ) during a stablecoin to defi swap on `AmirX.swap` with `directional == false` will cause issue when that target stable token is a fee on transfer token. ex: USDC might switch on fees, but code here is not modifying accordingly. 

### Internal pre-conditions



user swapping on `AmirX.swap` with `directional == false`

### External pre-conditions





A stable coin from liquidity safe which is not a `recognized stablecoin (XYZ)`, turns on fee to charge fee on transfer tax.

### Attack Path


1. user want to do a swap from stablecoin to _defiSwap in a non directional way of `AmirX.swap`

2. But the origin token is a external stablecoin(ex: ENA, GHO, USDC, USDT). So he wants to swap `stablecoin native to telcoin` into exetrnal stablecoin like ENA, into a defi swap (ENA to WETH). In this case he will call `AmirX.swap` with `directional == false`.

3. The issue is if the external stablecoin like USDC, ENA, switches on the fee on transfer tax, then the code is not modifying the wallet data that swaps external stable coin into WETH.

4. look at line 93, the `ss.oAmount` is modified to latest balance if any fee on tax is applied during defi to stablecoin swap route. But, when stablecoin to defi route, the code is not considering this by assuming all stable coins are FOT tax free. But they can switch on whenever they want. Lately, ENA received a proposal to switch on. USDC or USDT might do it when they want extra fees.

### Impact


The defi swaps will fail due to the FOT stable coin when swapping from stable coin to defi swap,because the wallet data is not updated considering the received stables after FOT tax. All swaps going from defi swap to stable swap route consider FOT tax, but the above mentioned case doesnâ€™t consider . Swaps fail on `AmirX.swap` with `directional == false`. so, DOS. PoCMitigation
