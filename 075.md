# Defi Swaps may end up with the same `iBalance` and `fBalance` which will incorrectly update `ss.oAmount`

### Summary

In [AmirX::swap()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-telcoin/blob/main/telcoin-audit/contracts/swap/AmirX.sol#L73), it updates `ss.oAmount` when the final `ss.origin` amount is different than the initial one. However, it should always update `ss.oAmount` as this is the most correct amount from the swap and it should not transfer funds from the wallet that were not swapped.

### Root Cause

In `AmirX:93`, it does not always update `ss.oAmount`, spending extra funds from the user that were not provided by the swap.

### Internal pre-conditions

None.

### External pre-conditions

None.

### Attack Path

User calls `AmirX:swap()` with an amount that leads to the same `ss.origin` balance before and after the swap. This may happen due to a combination of slippage and paying fees using a `feeToken` equal to `ss.origin`.

Suppose the user had 100 USDC and 5 AAVE in the wallet and defi swapped 5 AAVE for USDC. If the slippage + fees lead to a final wallet balance of 100 USDC, `ss.oAmount` will not be updated to 0 and it will transfer USDC out of the wallet which will end up with less than 100 USDC, when it should end up with exactly 100 USDC.

### Impact

The swapper transfers more `ss.origin` tokens out of the `wallet` than what the wallet swapped, which should never happen.

### PoC

```solidity
function swap(
    address wallet,
    bool directional,
    StablecoinSwap memory ss,
    DefiSwap memory defi
) external payable onlyRole(SWAPPER_ROLE) whenNotPaused {
    ...
    if (directional) {
        // if only defi swap
        if (ss.destination == address(0)) _defiSwap(wallet, defi);
        else {
            ...
            if (fBalance - iBalance != 0) ss.oAmount = fBalance - iBalance; //@audit should always update ss.oAmount 
            ...
        }
    } else {
        ...
    }
}
```

### Mitigation

```solidity
function swap(
    address wallet,
    bool directional,
    StablecoinSwap memory ss,
    DefiSwap memory defi
) external payable onlyRole(SWAPPER_ROLE) whenNotPaused {
    ...
    if (directional) {
        // if only defi swap
        if (ss.destination == address(0)) _defiSwap(wallet, defi);
        else {
            ...
            ss.oAmount = fBalance - iBalance; 
            ...
        }
    } else {
        ...
    }
}
```
