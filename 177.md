# Anyone may force the `SWAPPER_ROLE` to pay more gas in swaps by sending `ETH` or fee tokens to `AmirX`

### Summary

[AmirX::_buyBack()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-telcoin/blob/main/telcoin-audit/contracts/swap/AmirX.sol#L224) sends remaining native or `feeToken` to the `safe` whenever there are remaining values from the swap call. The `SWAPPER_ROLE` sponsors the call for the `wallet` spending a certain amount of gas and the wallet pays them in return. 

However, the amount of gas to pay may be calculated without considering that remaining `feeToken` would be left in the contract as the swap call would forward everything, but someone frontruns the call and sends `feeToken` to `AmirX`, forcing dust amounts to be sent to `defi.safe` and spending extra gas. 

Alternatively, the amount swapped is not completely predicatable and leftover `feeToken` amounts may unexpectedly still be in `AmirX` after the swap, but when the calculation of the gas to pay was made beforehand, offchain, it did not include the gas cost of sending these funds to the safe.

### Root Cause

In `AmirX:236/251`, the fee tokens in `AmirX` are sent to the Safe.

### Internal pre-conditions

None.

### External pre-conditions

None.

### Attack Path

1. Transaction is crafted offchain and simulated that no leftover fee token is left in the contract, forwading a certain amount of gas which the `wallet` will pay smaller than it should.
2. Malicious user forward 1 wei of `feeToken` to `AmirX`, triggering the calls to send the leftover `feeToken` to `safe` and spending more gas.
3. `AmirX::swap()` is called, spending more gas than initially thought, taking the `SWAPPER_ROLE` the loss.

### Impact

`SWAPPER_ROLE` can be drained if enough users perform the attack.

### PoC

None.

### Mitigation

Instead of sending the remaining balance of `feeToken` in the contract, send just the actual returned from the swap call.
