# POB - Lost funds in the `AmirX::_buyBack` function when `DefiSwap.defiSafe` is set to `address(0)`

### Summary

BuyBack can result in lost funds if `DefiSwap.defiSafe` is not set. There is no check in the `AmirX::_verifyDefiSwap` function to ensure that `DefiSwap.defiSafe` is not the zero address. In the BuyBack function, if `feeToken` is `POL` and there is still POL remaining in the contract after the swap (`address(this).balance > 0`), the remaining POL will be sent to the zero address. 

### Root Cause

In [AmirX::_verifyDefiSwap](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-telcoin/blob/main/telcoin-audit/contracts/swap/AmirX.sol#L264) function there is no check to ensure that `DefiSwap.defiSafe` is not the zero address.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. `DefiSwap.defiSafe` should be set to the zero address.  
2. `address(feeToken) == POL`.  
3. After the aggregator call `(bool polSwap,) = aggregator.call{value: msg.value}(swapData);`, there should be remaining POL (`address(this).balance > 0`)

### Impact

The bug in the BuyBack function causes any remaining POL after the swap to be sent to the zero address, resulting in lost funds.

### Mitigation

Add a condition in the `AmirX::_verifyDefiSwap` function to check if a non-zero `DefiSwap.defiSafe` address is provided.
