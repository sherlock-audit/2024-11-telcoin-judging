# POL Token Fee Handling Fails Due to Incorrect Use of msg.value in `_buyBack` Function

### Summary

The [_buyBack](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-telcoin/blob/main/telcoin-audit/contracts/swap/AmirX.sol#L224) function relies on msg.value (Ether sent with the transaction) to handle POL token fee payments, but this causes a critical bug when the fee token is POL. The function tries to use Ether to fund POL swaps, which is not possible as POL is a token, not Ether. This results in the AmirX contract being unable to properly fund POL transfers for swaps, leading to failures in buyback operations. The bug stems from a misunderstanding of how POL should be managed in the contract.

### Root Cause

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-telcoin/blob/main/telcoin-audit/contracts/swap/AmirX.sol#L231C9-L234C1

In the current implementation of the _buyBack() function, the contract uses msg.value to send Ether to an aggregator contract for POL token swaps:

```solidity
if (address(feeToken) == POL) {
    (bool polSwap, ) = aggregator.call{value: msg.value}(swapData);
    require(polSwap, "AmirX: POL swap transaction failed");
}
```
However, POL is an ERC-20 token, not Ether. msg.value is only valid for Ether transfers, meaning it cannot be used to fund a POL token transaction. This discrepancy between Ether and token handling leads to failures when trying to execute POL swaps..

Currently, there's no mechanism to guarantee that POL tokens are supplied to the contract before attempting the buyback swap, resulting in the failure to perform swaps with POL.
 POL buyback transactions will fail, which could prevent the intended token swap operations


### Internal pre-conditions

1. The _buyBack function checks if the feeToken is POL.
2. If feeToken == POL, the contract attempts to use msg.value to fund the POL swap transaction, which is invalid because msg.value can only transfer Ether, not tokens.
3. The contract attempts to use POL tokens from its balance after the swap, but if POL tokens were not pre-supplied or approved, the function will fail to perform the swap and may revert with a "POL swap transaction failed" error.


### External pre-conditions

1. The user (with the SWAPPER_ROLE) may send Ether (msg.value) as part of the transaction to fund the POL buyback.
2. The contract assumes that POL tokens can be swapped by sending Ether with msg.value, but this is only valid for Ether-based transfers, not ERC-20 token transfers.
3. The aggregator is a contract that handles the swap, but it expects Ether, not POL, when msg.value is passed. This discrepancy causes the contract to malfunction if POL is used as the fee token.

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

1. The buyback mechanism will fail when POL is used as the fee token, as the contract will try to use Ether (from msg.value) for the POL swap.
2. When feeToken == POL, the contract will not successfully complete the POL token swap because POL tokens cannot be transferred via Ether.
3. The contract's users may encounter failed transactions, with POL swaps not completing as expected, leading to a poor user experience

### PoC

1. Set up the contract with POL as the fee token: Deploy the contract and attempt a buyback with feeToken = POL.
2. Send a transaction with a non-zero msg.value (Ether) to the contract, expecting the POL fee to be paid via msg.value.
3. The contract will attempt to send POL using Ether (msg.value), but since POL is a token (not Ether), this will result in the error "POL swap transaction failed".
4. After the failure, the contract will not have processed the POL token swap, and POL will not be transferred to the safe address, leading to an incomplete transaction.

### Mitigation

Modify the `_buyBack()` function to not rely on msg.value for POL swaps. Instead, the contract should use the balance of POL tokens in the contract.
