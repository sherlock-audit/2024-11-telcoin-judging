# Unintended protocol behavior when doing swap more than two users

### Summary

Unintended protocol behavior when doing swap lead to an unexpected revert. This revert comes from unordered transactions where this accident could happen at anytime, causes inconvenience for users when doing swap.

### Root Cause

Let's see code below 

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-telcoin/blob/main/telcoin-audit/contracts/swap/AmirX.sol#L209-L213

Because of the `AmirX` creates a transfer all of funds with `telcoin.balanceOf(address(this))`, it automatically affect to move all of funds into address `defi.defiSafe`. For single transaction let's say just `Alice` transaction, it acceptable because just `Alice` token that would be move to address `defi.defiSafe`. But in another case, it doesn't acceptable.

Assume first, we go through normal case. We have two users that is `Alice` and `Bob`. They would swap their assets from `eUSD` to `eMXN` with fee token `telcoin` directly . The scenario looks like:
- `Alice` sends `telcoin` token to the `AmirX` as a referral fees and `Alice` creates a swap
- Also `Bob` sends `telcoin` token to the `AmirX` as a referral fees and `Bob` creates a swap
- The transactions will run normal

Assume second, we go through unnormal case. We have two users that is `Alice` and `Bob`. And also they would swap their assets from `eUSD` to `eMXN` with fee token with `telcoin` directly. This unnormal case can occur when:
- `Alice` sends `telcoin` token to the `AmirX` as a referral fees. And then `Bob` also sends `telcoin` token to the `AmirX` as a referral fees
- The `AmirX` protocol contains all of referral fees from `Alice` and `Bob`
- `Alice` creates a swap and then the` AmirX` moves all of funds (both referral fees of `Alice` and `Bob`) into `defi.defiSafe`
- Afterthat, `Bob` creates  a swap and the `Bob`'s transaction will revert because the referral fee of `Bob` already move first when `Alice` creates a swap.

### Impact

When we see the unnormal case above, the impact will affect to `Bob` that the protocol will revert his transaction and losing his referral fee. To avoid it, `Bob` must retransfer again to the `AmirX` and make `Bob` pays the referral fees twice (with notes that his second transaction in normal case). 


### PoC


```javascript
it("Unnormal case when doing swap", async () => {
            const stablecoinInputsAlice = {
                liquiditySafe: deployer,
                destination: holder,
                origin: eUSD,

            }

            const defiInputsAlice = {

                walletData: await wallet.getTestSelector(),
                swapData: await aggregator.getSwapSelector(),
            }

            const stablecoinInputsBob = {
                liquiditySafe: deployer,
                destination: holder,
                origin: eUSD,

                stablecoinFeeSafe: safe.address,
                feeAmount: 10
            }

            const defiInputsBob = {
                defiSafe: deployer,
                aggregator: aggregator,
                plugin: plugin,
                feeToken:  await telcoin.getAddress(),
                referrer: deployer,
                referralFee: 10,
                walletData: await wallet.getTestSelector(),
                swapData: await aggregator.getSwapSelector(),
            }

            await telcoin.mintTo(Alice,5);
            await telcoin.mintTo(Bob, 10);                

            await eUSD.mintTo(Alice, 105);                
            await eUSD.connect(Alice).approve(AmirX, 105);

            await eUSD.mintTo(Bob, 210);                
            await eUSD.connect(Bob).approve(AmirX, 210);

            await telcoin.connect(Alice).transfer(AmirX, 5);
            await telcoin.connect(Bob).transfer(AmirX, 10);

            await expect(AmirX.stablecoinToDefiSwap(Alice, stablecoinInputsAlice, defiInputsAlice)).to.not.be.reverted;
            // Bob transaction will revert
@>          await expect(AmirX.stablecoinToDefiSwap(Bob, stablecoinInputsBob, defiInputsBob)).to.be.reverted; 
            });
```

### Mitigation


Instead of using `telcoin.balanceOf(address(this))` as a value, recommend to use `defi.referralFee` as a value exatcly to avoid moving all of funds into address `defi.defiSafe`.

```diff
        if (TELCOIN.balanceOf(address(this)) > 0) 
               TELCOIN.safeTransfer( 
                     defi.defiSafe, 
-                    TELCOIN.balanceOf(address(this)), 
+                    defi.referralFee
              ); 
```
