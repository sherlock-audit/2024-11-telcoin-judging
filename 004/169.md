# `AmirX._buyBack` will sweep unrelated ERC20 tokens along with buyback remainders as token transfer sends entire contract balance

### Summary

The missing balance tracking in `AmirX._buyBack` function will cause unintended loss of accumulated ERC20 tokens for the `AmirX` contract as the function sends the entire contract's token balance rather than just the remainder from the current buyback operation. 

### Root Cause

In [`AmirX.sol:250-251`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-telcoin/blob/main/telcoin-audit/contracts/swap/AmirX.sol#L250-L251) the `AmirX._buyBack` function sends the entire contract's ERC20 token balance via `feeToken.balanceOf(address(this))` when handling token remainders after a buyback operation, instead of tracking the token balance difference and sending only the swap amount remainder from the current operation. While the actual swap amount is not directly accessible in the current codebase, the function should still only handle the remainder of the current operation rather than sweeping all tokens of that type in the contract. 

### Internal pre-conditions

1. Contract needs to have accumulated ERC20 token balance (of the same type as feeToken) from sources other than current buyback operation
2. `AmirX.swap()` or `AmirX.defiSwap()` needs to be called with a `DefiSwap` struct containing a non-POL ERC20 token as feeToken
3. The aggregator swap operation needs to complete successfully

### External pre-conditions

No specific external protocol conditions required

### Attack Path

1. User or another contract transfers ERC20 tokens (`Token A`) directly to AmirX contract
2. Authorized SWAPPER_ROLE calls `AmirX.swap()` or `AmirX.defiSwap()` with `Token A` as `feeToken`
3. The operation reaches `AmirX._buyBack()` function
4. After performing `Token A` to `TELCOIN` swap via aggregator call
5. `AmirX._buyBack()` executes `feeToken.safeTransfer(safe, remainder)` where remainder is calculated as the entire balance of `Token A` in the contract, leading to sweeping all `Token A` including the pre-existing balance unrelated to this buyback

### Impact

The `AmirX` contract suffers loss of accumulated ERC20 tokens unrelated to the current buyback operation. While these funds can be recovered via `AmirX.rescueCrypto()`, it requires additional gas costs and administrative overhead from `SUPPORT_ROLE` holders to monitor and recover the tokens. The attacker does not directly gain from this but could use it to force unnecessary operations and gas consumption from the protocol administrators. This affects any ERC20 token used as feeToken, making it broader in scope than a similar POL-related issue.

### Mitigation

Since we cannot directly access the swap amount in the current contract design, here are the suggested solutions to mitigate this issue: 
- Modify the contract design to explicitly pass and track the swap amount
- Add a parameter in the `DefiSwap` struct to specify the amount of tokens being swapped
- These allow precise tracking of how many tokens should be involved in the operation
