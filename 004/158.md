# `AmirX._buyBack` will sweep unrelated POL tokens along with buyback remainders as POL transfer sends entire contract balance

### Summary

The missing balance tracking in `AmirX._buyBack` function will cause unintended loss of accumulated POL tokens for the `AmirX` contract as the function sends the entire contract's POL balance rather than just the remainder from the current buyback operation

### Root Cause

In [`AmirX.sol:235-238`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-telcoin/blob/main/telcoin-audit/contracts/swap/AmirX.sol#L235-L238) the `AmirX._buyBack` function sends the entire contract's POL balance via `address(this).balance` when handling POL remainders after a buyback operation, instead of tracking POL balance difference and sending only the `msg.value` remainder from the current operation. This leads to sweeping all POL tokens in the contract, including those unrelated to the current buyback. 

### Internal pre-conditions

1. Contract needs to have accumulated POL balance from sources other than current buyback operation (e.g. direct transfers or other operations)
2. `AmirX.swap()` or `AmirX.defiSwap()` needs to be called with a `DefiSwap` struct containing POL as feeToken
3. The aggregator swap operation needs to return some POL remaining after the swap

### External pre-conditions

No specific external protocol conditions required

### Attack Path

1. User or another contract directly sends POL to `AmirX` contract, building up POL balance unrelated to buybacks
2. Authorized `SWAPPER_ROLE` calls `AmirX.swap()` or `AmirX.defiSwap()` with valid parameters and POL as feeToken
3. The operation reaches `AmirX._buyBack()` function
4. After performing POL to TELCOIN swap via aggregator, some POL remains
5. `AmirX._buyBack()` executes `safe.call{value: address(this).balance}("")`, sending ALL contract's POL balance to safe address, including the pre-existing POL that was unrelated to this buyback

### Impact

The `AmirX` contract suffers loss of accumulated POL tokens unrelated to the current buyback operation. While these funds can be recovered via `AmirX.rescueCrypto()`, it requires additional gas costs and administrative overhead from `SUPPORT_ROLE` holders to monitor and recover the tokens. The attacker does not directly gain from this but could use it to force unnecessary operations and gas consumption from the protocol administrators.

### PoC


### Mitigation

The contract should track only the remaining portion of msg.value after the swap operation, since this represents the actual remainder from the current buyback. Here's the correct fix:

```solidity
function _buyBack(
    ERC20 feeToken,
    address aggregator,
    address safe,
    bytes memory swapData
) internal {
    if (address(feeToken) == address(0)) return;
    if (address(feeToken) == POL) {
        // Store initial balance
        uint256 initialBalance = address(this).balance;

        // Perform the swap
        (bool polSwap, ) = aggregator.call{value: msg.value}(swapData);
        require(polSwap, "AmirX: POL swap transaction failed");

        // Calculate how much POL was actually used by aggregator
        uint256 balanceDiff = initialBalance - address(this).balance;
        
        // Calculate remaining portion of msg.value that wasn't used
        uint256 remainingPOL = msg.value - balanceDiff;
        
        // Send only the remaining portion of msg.value
        if (remainingPOL > 0) {
            (bool success, ) = safe.call{value: remainingPOL}("");
            require(success, "AmirX: POL send transaction failed");
        }
    } else {
        // ... rest of function for non-POL tokens
    }
}

```
