# `removeBlackList` will not return the user funds back which was taken at the time of blacklisting

### Summary

When a user is blacklisting, their entire balance is taken, this balance should be returned back to user when `removeBlacklist` is called but it is not the case here. 

### Root Cause

`In `Blacklist.sol:removeBlacklist`, the seized funds are not returned back to user. 



### Internal pre-conditions

`addBlacklist` function seize the user balance using `_onceBlacklisted` function. 

```solidity
function addBlackList(
        address user
    ) public virtual onlyRole(BLACKLISTER_ROLE) {
        if (blacklisted(user)) revert AlreadyBlacklisted(user);
        _onceBlacklisted(user);
        // do this after so it doesnt trip blacklisted restirctions
        _setBlacklist(user, true);
        emit AddedBlacklist(user);
    }

```

```solidity
 function _onceBlacklisted(address user) internal override {
        _transfer(user, _msgSender(), balanceOf(user));
    }
```

There is a function `removeBlacklist` which can be used to remove the user from blacklist but this function doesn't return the seized funds back to user, essentially leading to the loss of fund for user. 

```solidity
  function removeBlackList(
        address user
    ) public virtual onlyRole(BLACKLISTER_ROLE) {
        if (!blacklisted(user)) revert NotBlacklisted(user);
        _setBlacklist(user, false);
        emit RemovedBlacklist(user);
    }
```


### External pre-conditions

### Attack Path

1. `BLACKLISTER` calls `addBlacklist` to blacklist user. 
2. User is now blacklisted and his funds are seized. 
3. after someone `BLACKLISTER` release that he made a mistake on blacklisting a user. 
4. He call `removeBlacklist` to remove a genuine user from blacklist. 
5. The user is removed from blacklist but his funds seized earlier are never returned. 

### Impact
