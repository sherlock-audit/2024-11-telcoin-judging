# Using call function in buyback function can result unexpected state changes or financial losses

### Summary

If the `aggregator` or `safe` addresses of `DefiSwap` struct have fallback functions, they could call back into the _buyBack function before the first transaction completes, potentially leading to unexpected state changes or financial losses.

### Root Cause

In `AmirX.sol::_buyBack` function and `AmirX.sol::defiSwap` function, there are 4 places where `call` functions are used:
- [Line 168](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-telcoin/blob/main/telcoin-audit/contracts/swap/AmirX.sol#L168)
- [Line 232](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-telcoin/blob/main/telcoin-audit/contracts/swap/AmirX.sol#L232)
- [Line 236](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-telcoin/blob/main/telcoin-audit/contracts/swap/AmirX.sol#L236)
- [Line 247](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-telcoin/blob/main/telcoin-audit/contracts/swap/AmirX.sol#L247)

The addresses that are used in this lines are from the transaction arguments and they can be a contract address and have a fallback function which could call back into the contract functions before the first transaction completes.

This potentially leads to unexpected state changes or financial losses.

### Mitigation

There are several possible solutions.
- Use `transfer`, `transferFrom`, `approve` functions instead of `call`. This ensures leveraging the safety and checks provided by these functions.
- Implement reentrancy guards like the following:
```solidity
import "@openzeppelin/contracts/security/ReentrancyGuard.sol";
... 
function _buyBack(...) internal nonReentrant {
```
- Specify a gas limit to prevent the called contract from consuming too much gas
```solidity
(bool success, ) = aggregator.call{value: msg.value, gas: 50000}(swapData);
```
