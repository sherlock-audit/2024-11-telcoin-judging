# `stablecoin::Stablecoin.sol` has `renounceRole` function from OpenZepellin's `AccessControlUpgradeable.sol` that can be called, making mint, burn and rescue functions unusable

### Summary

The `StableCoin` contract inherits from Blacklist contract, which inherits from OpenZeppelinâ€™s `AccessControlUpgradeable`, which provides a `renounceRole` function allowing any account to renounce roles it has been assigned. This allows the assignees to renounce their `MINTER_ROLE`, `BURNER_ROLE` and `SUPPORT_ROLE`, effectively removing their authority to call the mint, burn and erc20Rescue functions unusable.

### Root Cause

This is a public function in the OpenZeppelin's `AccessControlUpgradeable.sol` contract.
https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts-upgradeable/blob/ee3a7e4f38c62bcd22727489218b29f3b893594a/contracts/access/AccessControlUpgradeable.sol#L178C1-L184C6

```javascript
function renounceRole(bytes32 role, address callerConfirmation) public virtual {
        if (callerConfirmation != _msgSender()) {
            revert AccessControlBadConfirmation();
        }

        _revokeRole(role, callerConfirmation);
    }
```
The assignees can use this function as it is public, and renounce their important roles i.e., MINTER_ROLE, BURNER_ROLE and SUPPORT_ROLE, making the functions uncallable

### Attack Path

- An assignee calls the `renounceRole` function within the `StableCoin.sol` contract. It could be called by an attacker, if the wallet was somehow compromised too.
- He can successfully renounce the `MINTER_ROLE`, `BURNER_ROLE` or `SUPPORT_ROLE`, effectively removing their authority to make the function calls.

### Impact

This bug undermines the functionality of the contract. Since this can renounce the specific roles, the mint, burn and erc20Rescue functions in the contract are potentially uncallable.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Override the `renounceRole` function to prevent from renouncing the role. Implement the following code to restrict `renounceRole` functionality:

```javascript
function renounceRole(bytes32, address) public virtual override {
    revert OperationNotAllowed();
}
```

This modification ensures that anyone can't renounce the `MINTER_ROLE`, `BURNER_ROLE` and `SUPPORT_ROLE`, preserving the functionality of the contract.
