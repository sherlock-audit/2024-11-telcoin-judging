# Lack of Reserved Storage Slots in Stablecoin.sol and StableCoinHandler Upgradeable Contracts

### Summary

The `Stablecoin.sol` and `StableCoinHandler` contracts are designed to be upgradeable but do not include reserved storage slots. Upgradeable contracts need reserved storage slots to ensure future upgrades do not unintentionally overwrite existing storage variables. Without these reserved slots, future upgrades or modifications may corrupt or erase critical data, leading to potential loss of funds, broken functionality, or other unintended consequences.

### Mitigation

To ensure safe and reliable upgrades, reserve storage slots at the end of the storage layout in both Stablecoin.sol and StableCoinHandler. This allows future contract versions to introduce new storage variables without overwriting existing data
