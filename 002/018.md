# `swap` function logic can result in minimum supply violation

### Summary

In the `AmirX` contract, the `swap` function performs a `_verifyStablecoinSwap` check before calling `_defiSwap` when `directional` is true and `ss.destination != address(0)`. However, the value of `ss.oAmount` is modified after this validation, potentially leading to unintended behavior where the total supply of the stablecoin drops below the minimum limit.

### Root Cause

The `_verifyStablecoinSwap` function ensures that the stablecoin's total supply does not fall below the minimum limit after the burn operation by checking:

However, in the `swap` function, `ss.oAmount` is recalculated after this verification following a call to `_defiSwap`:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-telcoin/blob/main/telcoin-audit/contracts/swap/AmirX.sol#L89-L94

This can lead to scenarios where the recalculated `ss.oAmount` exceeds the permissible limit and breaches the minimum supply during the subsequent `_stablecoinSwap`.

### Internal pre-conditions

- The `swap` function is called with `directional` set to true and `ss.destination != address(0)`.
- The initial `_verifyStablecoinSwap` check passes.
- `ss.oAmount` is modified after verification.

### External pre-conditions

- The contract is not paused.
- The caller has the `SWAPPER_ROLE`.

### Attack Path

1. A user triggers the `swap` function with `directional` set to true.
2. The initial `_verifyStablecoinSwap` check passes.
3. `_defiSwap` is called, which modifies `ss.oAmount` to `fBalance - iBalance` after the check.
4. `_stablecoinSwap` is called with the modified `ss.oAmount`.
5. If `ss.oAmount` now results in `totalSupply - ss.oAmount < getMinLimit(ss.origin)`, the minimum limit condition is breached.

### Impact

- The stablecoin's total supply can unintentionally drop below the minimum limit, violating contract safety constraints.
- This can result in potential financial instability or issues within the ecosystem using the stablecoin.

### PoC

- The initial call to `_verifyStablecoinSwap` passes.
- The balance change `fBalance - iBalance` after the DeFi swap results in a higher `ss.oAmount`.
- This higher `ss.oAmount` causes a breach when `_stablecoinSwap` is executed.


### Mitigation

Ensure that `ss.oAmount` is not modified after `_verifyStablecoinSwap` or add a re-validation step after `_defiSwap` and before calling `_stablecoinSwap`:
```diff
 uint256 iBalance = ERC20(ss.origin).balanceOf(wallet);
 if (defi.walletData.length != 0) _defiSwap(wallet, defi);
 uint256 fBalance = ERC20(ss.origin).balanceOf(wallet);
 
 if (fBalance - iBalance != 0) {
     ss.oAmount = fBalance - iBalance;
 
+    // Revalidate the total supply condition before proceeding
+    if (isXYZ(ss.origin) && Stablecoin(ss.origin).totalSupply() - ss.oAmount < getMinLimit(ss.origin))
+        revert InvalidMintBurnBoundry(ss.origin, ss.oAmount);
 }
 
 _stablecoinSwap(wallet, ss);
```
This ensures that the total supply condition holds true for the final `ss.oAmount` used in `_stablecoinSwap`.
