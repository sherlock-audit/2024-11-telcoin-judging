# `AmirX:_verifyDefiSwap()` does not check if the value of the `safe` is `address(0)` in spit of the readme

### Summary

[AmirX:_verifyDefiSwap()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-telcoin/blob/main/telcoin-audit/contracts/swap/AmirX.sol#L264) does not check if `defi.safe` is `address(0)`, which means that in `AmirX:_buyBack()` remaining POL/token balances may be sent to `address(0)`, breaking the readme:
> However is the value for a safe is not passed in tokens should not be able to be sent into space or the zero address.

### Root Cause

In `AmirX:264`, `defi.safe` is not check for `address(0)`.

### Internal pre-conditions

None.

### External pre-conditions

None.

### Attack Path

1. Swapper calls `AmirX:swap()` with a `feeToken` other than `Telcoin` and `address(0)` and a `defi.safe` of `address(0)`, sending tokens to `address(0)`.

### Impact

The tokens are sent to `address(0)` instead of the safe contrarily to the readme.

### PoC

```solidity
if (defi.feeToken != TELCOIN && address(defi.feeToken) != address(0)) {
    if (defi.aggregator == address(0) || defi.swapData.length == 0)
        revert ZeroValueInput("BUYBACK");
}
```

### Mitigation

Add `defi.safe` check:
```solidity
if (defi.feeToken != TELCOIN && address(defi.feeToken) != address(0)) {
    if (defi.aggregator == address(0) || defi.swapData.length == 0 || defi.safe == address(0))
        revert ZeroValueInput("BUYBACK");
}
```
