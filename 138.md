This is the function that actually performs the DeFi swap. It is called by the defiSwap function (and other swap-related functions like swap, stablecoinToDefiSwap, and defiToStablecoinSwap) to execute the DeFi transaction.

The function _defiSwap checks if the wallet interaction (a transaction call to the walletData) is successful, but it doesn't specify a minimum amount for the transaction as a result users will receive less than expected
