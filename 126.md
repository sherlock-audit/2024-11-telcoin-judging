# Stablecoin Swap with zero fee is impossible in `StablecoinHandler` Contract

### Summary

The `_stablecoinSwap` function in the `StablecoinHandler` contract has an issue where swaps with a fee amount (`ss.feeAmount`) set to zero can trigger an unintended revert. This restricts the ability to conduct fee-less swaps, impacting the flexibility and utility of the contract.


### Root Cause

The root cause of the issue lies in the logic within `_stablecoinSwap`:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-telcoin/blob/main/telcoin-audit/contracts/stablecoin/StablecoinHandler.sol#L152-L156

```solidity
ERC20PermitUpgradeable(ss.stablecoinFeeCurrency).safeTransferFrom(
    wallet,
    ss.stablecoinFeeSafe,
    ss.feeAmount
);
```

This code executes a `safeTransferFrom` call without checking if `ss.feeAmount` is zero. If the ERC20 token used does not handle zero-value transfers gracefully, the function call may revert.

### External pre-conditions

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

- **Inability to Conduct Fee-Less Swaps**: Any swap attempt with `ss.feeAmount` set to zero will revert, effectively disallowing transactions where no fee is needed.
- **Operational Restrictions**: The contract's utility is limited, as users or integrators cannot initiate swaps without incurring a fee, even if such transactions are intended.


### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation


Implement a conditional check to ensure that `safeTransferFrom` is only executed when `ss.feeAmount` is greater than zero. This modification will prevent reverts due to zero-value transfers:

```solidity
if (
    ss.stablecoinFeeCurrency != address(0) &&
    ss.stablecoinFeeSafe != address(0) &&
    ss.feeAmount > 0
) {
    ERC20PermitUpgradeable(ss.stablecoinFeeCurrency).safeTransferFrom(
        wallet,
        ss.stablecoinFeeSafe,
        ss.feeAmount
    );
}
```

This change ensures that swaps can proceed without a fee if desired and improves the contract's overall flexibility and reliability.
