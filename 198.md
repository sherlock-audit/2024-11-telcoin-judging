# Total supply of stable coin can be less than minimum supply in such cases

### Summary

- When `defiToStablecoinSwap` is used, there is a possibility of total supply can be less than min supply.
- For example - minimum total supply is 100 eUSD and current supply is 150.
- User wants to swap AAVE - eUSD - USDC and amounts are 50-50-50.
- When user calls this oAmount will be 50 and it is verify before stable coin swap.

- And it will pass because min supply limit will not breach (150-50 = 100).
- But when defi swap happens for AAVE to eUSD, if price changes in aggregator, wallet can get more than 50 lets suppose wallet get 55 eUSD.
- Now stable coin swap happens for eUSD to USDC in which 55 eUSD will be burned because oAmount will be changed.
- So total supply will be 150 - 55 = 95 which is less than min supply (100).

### Root Cause

- After stable coin verify, the oAmount changes which cause this issue.

### Impact

-Total supply of stable coin can be less than minimum supply.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

- Protocol should verify stable coin after the change in oAmount or while burning the stable coin, protocol should check that it will not be less then min supply.
