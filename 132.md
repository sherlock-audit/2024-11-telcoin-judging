# when feeToken is set to POL aggregator is called with msg.value instead of address(this).balance

### Summary

in defi swaps, forwarding `msg.value` instead of `address(this).balance` to aggregator will cause `buyback`s to fail for swaps with `feeToken` set to `POL` because `msg.value` is zero. (`address(this).balance` must be used instead)

### Root Cause

- According to sponsor comment, we know that fee tokens are sent to contract after swap is done, i.e in here: https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-telcoin/blob/main/telcoin-audit/contracts/swap/AmirX.sol#L168-L169
- So If `feeToken` is set to `POL` (Polygon native token) then `wallet` sends native coins to the contract.
- In `_buyback` if `feeToken` is set to `POL` we must use `address(this).balance` which is the amount of ether sent by `wallet`, but we are using `msg.value` instead which has nothing to do with fees: https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-telcoin/blob/main/telcoin-audit/contracts/swap/AmirX.sol#L231-L233

### Internal pre-conditions

- `feeToken` must be set to `POL`

### Attack Path

1- Telecoin platform initiates a defiSwap with buyback, the buyback will swap `1e18 POL` for `TELECOIN`
2- `wallet` is called with `walletData` and swap is done: https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-telcoin/blob/main/telcoin-audit/contracts/swap/AmirX.sol#L168C1-L169C67
3- `wallet` sends back 1e18 POL tokens as fee to AmirX, this is true according to sponsor's comment in discord channel about fees: 

> so you are saying that fee tokens are present after wallet is called with walletData, i.e after swap is execution in case of _defiSwap.
> its not that they are in the contract beforehand 

> Correct. They are not in the contract prior. When the wallet does the defi swap some of the funds are sent to the user and the fee is sent to AmirX

4- `_buyback` function calls aggregator with `swapData`, trying to swap `1e18 POL` to `TELECOIN`, but its forwarding `msg.value` which is `zero`, the swap reverts because not enough `POL` is provided to aggregator: https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-telcoin/blob/main/telcoin-audit/contracts/swap/AmirX.sol#L231-L233

### Impact

The users can not execute defiSwaps with `feeToken` set to `POL`

### Mitigation

use `address(this).balance` instead of `msg.value`:

```solidity
        if (address(feeToken) == POL) {
            (bool polSwap, ) = aggregator.call{value: address(this).balance}(swapData);
            require(polSwap, "AmirX: POL swap transaction failed");

            if (address(this).balance > 0) {
                (bool success, ) = safe.call{value: address(this).balance}("");
                require(success, "AmirX: POL send transaction failed");
            }
```
