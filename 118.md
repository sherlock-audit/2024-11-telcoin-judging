# In the `AmiriX::swap` and the AmiriX::defiToStablecoinSwap` the `ss.tAmount`  is not changed.

### Summary

The `ss.oAmount` given is initially used to calculate the `ss.tAmount` offchain, but in the `AmiriX::swap` and the `AmiriX::defiToStablecoinSwap` functions, the `ss.oAmount` is set to the amount gotten from the defi swap, but the `ss.tAmount` is not recalculated.

### Root Cause

In the [`AmiriX::swap`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-telcoin/blob/main/telcoin-audit/contracts/swap/AmirX.sol#L93) and [`AmiriX::defiToStablecoinSwap`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-telcoin/blob/main/telcoin-audit/contracts/swap/AmirX.sol#L125) the `ss.oAmount` is set to amount of tokens gotten from the defi swap but the `ss.tAmount` is not changed to match it.

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

- User wants to swap token A to token C (token A is a defi token and token C is an XYZ token)
- The `ss.oAmount` is the estimated amount of the intermediate stablecoin token (token B) to swap to before swapping to XYZ token 
- The swap first occurs from defi token A to defi stablecoin B, then the `ss.Amount` is changed to the actual amount of token B gotten from the swap.
- The `ss.oAmount` of the origin currency is swapped for the `ss.tAmount` of the XYZ token

### Impact

If the origin token(token B)  is a fee-on-transfer token the `ss.oAmount` will be less than the estimate, and since the `ss.tAmount` is not recalculated using the actual amount of token B sent, the amount of XYZ tokens minted to the user will be more than required for the actual amount of the origin token(token B) sent.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Recalculate the `ss.tAmount` when recalculating the `ss.oAmount`.
