# AmirX.sol - stuck funds can be stolen via arbitrary trades, instead of being rescued by the `SUPPORT`

### Summary

The `AmirX.sol` contract executes all stablecoin, defi and their mixed trades, handling the buy backs and fee distributions resulting from those trades. The contract introduces a `SUPPORT` role meant to be able to rescue mistakenly sent funds or funds which ended up as stuck as dust, as a result of some arbitrary swap aggregator logic.
However, due to a few lacking input validations for the user provided swap structs, anyone would be able to steal those stuck funds. 

### Root Cause

The core issue is the fact that the addresses provided with the swap parameters are not sanitized from any values, other than the `address(0)` check inside `nonZero` modifier:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-telcoin/blob/main/telcoin-audit/contracts/stablecoin/StablecoinHandler.sol#L103-L110

This, combined with the ways that allowances work, could allow any swapper to provide the address of the `AmirX` contract as a wallet and take out the funds and send them to themselves, stealing any residual funds inside the contract.

### Attack Path

1. Due to trades, some accidental fund sends, etc, the `AmirX` contract has accumulated some X funds of a token
2. Bob notices this and executes a plain `stablecoinSwap` with parameters: `wallet = address(AmirX)`, `oAmount = X`, `liquiditySafe = destination = address(Bob)`. He would also need to grant the contract allowance, as it will try to take the funds out of his fake safe, which is his own address
3. He executes the swap and depending on the token it will either: get burned from the contract and minted to him OR get transferred out of the contract and to himself (twice, which is irrelevant). The transfer would work since the `wallet` will be the `AmirX` contract, thus `transferFrom` would not need an allowance, the contract is transferring those funds out of itself.

This is one of the ways the arbitrary parameters can be used to manipulate the residual funds, the other one is to set a `tAmount` that accounts for the stuck funds and set `liquiditySafe = AmirX`. This way the line: https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-telcoin/blob/main/telcoin-audit/contracts/stablecoin/StablecoinHandler.sol#L175-L178
would send the dust to the attacker.

### Impact

Users are able to steal and execute stablecoin swaps with stuck funds, meant to be rescued and saved.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Sanitize the addresses provided as part of the swap params, such as that the wallet and liquiditySafe cannot be equal to the `AmirX` contract address and other critical addresses that could hold funds.
