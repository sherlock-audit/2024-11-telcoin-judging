# The Attacker can steal stablecoins by stablecoinSwap function in StablecoinHandler.sol

### Summary

In this contract, when the user is going to swap the coin, he uses the stablecoinsSwap but here, before swapping, in verify, the attacker uses the overflow and underflow of Uint256.
So he passes the verify with large amount of the origin token and steals.

### Root Cause

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-telcoin/blob/main/telcoin-audit/contracts/stablecoin/StablecoinHandler.sol#L205

In StablecoinHandler.sol:205, if the attacker sets the  ss.oAmount = 2^256-1 and totalSupply = 2000,
( Stablecoin(ss.origin).totalSupply() - ss.oAmount) is minus value.
But in Uint256, -2000 =  2^256 - 2000  > getMinLimit(ss.origin) and in line 208 ,2^256-1+200 = 200 < getMaxLimit(ss.target).
So he can pass and steal.

### Internal pre-conditions

Attacker sets the input value as much as possible, for example 2^256-1.

### External pre-conditions

Attacker can steal the large amount.


### Attack Path

The Attacker can use stablecoinSwap() function to exchage.
Because the system verify  by only Max and Min limitation.

### Impact

Attacker can steal total amount of the system.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

If the user input the value, the system must check and verify the input value.
