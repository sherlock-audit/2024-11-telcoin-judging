### Summary

`StablecoinHandler::_stablecoinSwap()` would fail under certain conditions

### Root Cause

### Internal pre-conditions

- `ss.stablecoinFeeSafe` token should be different then `ss.origin` token

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

- Let's understand using an example.
- Let's suppose user want to swap USDC to eUSDC (stablecoin to stablecoin) and `ss.stablecoinFeeCurrency is set as target address (i.e eUSDC)`
- Now for swapping `stablecoinSwap()` would get used with `ss.origin as Usdc Addr and ss.stablecoinFeeCurrency as eUSDC address` and with other inputs.
```solidity
function _stablecoinSwap(
        address wallet,
        StablecoinSwap memory ss
    ) internal {
        if (
            ss.stablecoinFeeCurrency != address(0) &&
            ss.stablecoinFeeSafe != address(0)
        )
            ERC20PermitUpgradeable(ss.stablecoinFeeCurrency).safeTransferFrom(
                wallet,
                ss.stablecoinFeeSafe,
                ss.feeAmount
            );

        // Handle the transfer or burning of the origin currency:
        // If the origin is a recognized stablecoin (XYZ), burn the specified amount from the wallet.
        if (isXYZ(ss.origin)) {
            Stablecoin(ss.origin).burnFrom(wallet, ss.oAmount);
        } else {
            ERC20PermitUpgradeable(ss.origin).safeTransferFrom(
                wallet,
                ss.liquiditySafe,
                ss.oAmount
            );
        }

        // Handle the minting or transferring of the target currency:
        // If the target is a recognized stablecoin (XYZ), mint the required amount to the destination address.
        if (isXYZ(ss.target)) {
            Stablecoin(ss.target).mintTo(ss.destination, ss.tAmount);
        } else {
            ERC20PermitUpgradeable(ss.target).safeTransferFrom(
                ss.liquiditySafe,
                ss.destination,
                ss.tAmount
            );
        }
```    
- During swap if we look closely the wallet will not have `eUSDC` token inside wallet as before the swap the user has only USDC in wallet so during transferFrom from wallet to stablecoinFeeSafe the transaction would revert.
```solidity
ERC20PermitUpgradeable(ss.stablecoinFeeCurrency).safeTransferFrom(
                wallet,
                ss.stablecoinFeeSafe,
                ss.feeAmount
            );
```

- So whenever `ss.stablecoinFeeSafe` and `ss.origin` in stable coin swap is different then it would fail.

### Impact

- `StablecoinHandler::_stablecoinSwap()` would fail whenever  `ss.stablecoinFeeSafe` and `ss.origin` in stable coin swap is different

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

- Add a check that `ss.stablecoinFeeSafe` and `ss.origin` are not different.
