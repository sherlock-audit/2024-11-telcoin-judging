# `defiToStablecoinSwap()` would fail if `ss.stablecoinFeeCurrency` and `ss.origin` token are same

### Summary

`defiToStablecoinSwap()` would fail if `ss.stablecoinFeeCurrency` and `ss.origin` token are same

### Root Cause

### Internal pre-conditions

- `ss.stablecoinFeeSafe` token should be same as `ss.origin` token

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

- Let's understand using an example.
- Let's suppose user want to swap 100 AAVE to 100 eUSDC and `ss.stablecoinFeeCurrency is set as ORIGIN address (i.e USDC)`
- Now First `_defiswap()` would happen and after execution user's wallet would be getting approx 100 USDC for swapping 100 AAVE tokens.
- So now user's wallet balance is 100 USDC.
- Now stable coin swap would happen from USDC to eUSDC using `_stablecoinSwap()`
- Inside `_stablecoinSwap()`, fee gets transferred to stablecoinFeeSafe adddress lets assume 5 USDC gets transferred as feeAmount is 5.
```solidity
ERC20PermitUpgradeable(ss.stablecoinFeeCurrency).safeTransferFrom(
                wallet,
                ss.stablecoinFeeSafe,
                ss.feeAmount
            );
```            
- So now user's wallet balance would be 95 USDC.
- After that USDC gets transferred to liquidity Safe address and `amount of USDC transferred = ss.oAmount which is 100 USDC `
```solidity
ERC20PermitUpgradeable(ss.origin).safeTransferFrom(
                wallet,
                ss.liquiditySafe,
                
                ss.oAmount
            );
```
- Now as wallet has only 95 USDC left the above call would fail due to insufficient balance in wallet.
- Due to this whole  defiToStablecoinSwap() would revert.

### Impact

- `defiToStablecoinSwap` would fail whenever `ss.stablecoinFeeSafe` and `ss.origin` in defi to stable coin swap is same

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

- Make sure if `ss.stablecoinFeeSafe` and `ss.origin` are same then subtract ss.feeAmount from ss.oAmount
```solidity
ERC20PermitUpgradeable(ss.origin).safeTransferFrom(
                wallet,
                ss.liquiditySafe,
                
                ss.oAmount - ss.feeAmount
            );
```
