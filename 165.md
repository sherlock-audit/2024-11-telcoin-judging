# wrong validation check for referrer

### Summary

the verifydefiswap function validates the paramter for a defi swap

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-telcoin/blob/main/telcoin-audit/contracts/swap/AmirX.sol#L264-L277

however a wrong validation check will always result in refferr address being 0

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-telcoin/blob/main/telcoin-audit/contracts/swap/AmirX.sol#L275


this is not the intended behaviour of the contract which can be figured out by how feedispersal is implemented
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-telcoin/blob/main/telcoin-audit/contracts/swap/AmirX.sol#L194


### Root Cause

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

not an attack

### Impact

as a result the referrer address will always be 0 while swapping additionally if theres a referrer the validation will always revert
the verifydefiswap is used by defiswap before executing a swap and is a crucial function uneccessary revert will DoS the function whenever there is a referrer

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

check if theres a referrer and if the referrer address is not 0
