# Underfunding of Buyback and Fee Distributions Due to Fee-on-Transfer Tokens

### Summary

The assumption that full `feeToken` balances transfer without deduction will cause a shortfall in distributed amounts for fee-on-transfer tokens, as the automatic transfer fee reduces the received amount when `feeToken` is forwarded to the aggregator or `defiSafe`.

### Root Cause

The choice to rely on `feeToken.balanceOf(address(this))` for full transfers without accounting for transfer fees is a mistake, as fee-on-transfer tokens will result in a smaller-than-expected amount reaching the destination.

Issue Location
The issue appears in the following lines within _buyBack and _feeDispersal:
1. [_buyBack](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-telcoin/blob/main/telcoin-audit/contracts/swap/AmirX.sol#L224)
2. [_feeDispersal](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-telcoin/blob/main/telcoin-audit/contracts/swap/AmirX.sol#L183)

### Internal pre-conditions

1. `SWAPPER_ROLE` needs to call `swap()` or another function that invokes `_feeDispersal` or `_buyBack` using a fee-on-transfer token as `feeToken`.
2. `feeToken` must apply a transfer fee.

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. `SWAPPER_ROLE` calls `swap()` or a related function with a fee-on-transfer token as `feeToken`.
2. In `_feeDispersal` or `_buyBack`, `feeToken` is forwarded to the aggregator or `defiSafe`.
3. Due to the transfer fee, the aggregator or `defiSafe` receives less than expected, potentially causing the buyback swap to fail or creating a shortfall in the distributed amount.

### Impact

The protocol suffers from reduced reliability in buyback and fee distribution amounts, especially when handling fee-on-transfer tokens. This inconsistency can cause failed transactions in the aggregator or underpayment to `defiSafe`.

Using fee-on-transfer tokens without adjustments may lead to inconsistent buyback or fee distribution results due to transfer fees, affecting the stability and predictability of protocol operations.

### PoC

1. Deploy a fee-on-transfer ERC20 token.
2. Call `swap()` with this token as `feeToken`.
3. Observe that the aggregator or `defiSafe` receives a reduced amount compared to the full `feeToken` balance.

### Mitigation

1. **Implement Balance Check Adjustments**: Calculate the actual received amount after each transfer to account for fees.
2. **Identify Fee-on-Transfer Tokens:** Consider pre-detecting fee-on-transfer tokens and adjusting expected transfer values accordingly.
