# POB - Underflow in `AmirX::swap` and `AmirX::defiToStablecoinSwap` functions

### Summary

The `AmirX::swap` and `AmirX::defiToStablecoinSwap` functions can revert due to an underflow. If the DeFi fee is greater than the swap amount, the balance of `ERC20(ss.origin).balanceOf(wallet)` after the swap will be lower than it was before the swap, causing an underflow. This can lead to unexpected behavior, transaction failures, and potentially loss of funds or disrupted operations.

### Root Cause

The root cause of the issue is that the DeFi fee being greater than the swap amount in the `AmirX::defiToStablecoinSwap` function causes an underflow. Specifically, if the fee deducted exceeds the swap amount, the balance of the token in the wallet after the swap can become negative or smaller than expected, triggering an underflow.

### Internal Pre-Conditions

1. The same token is used for both the DeFi fee and the swap amount (`ss.origin` is the token used for both the fee and the swap).
2. The DeFi fee is greater than the swap amount, meaning that after deducting the fee, the remaining balance of the wallet is smaller than expected.

### Attack Path

Loc: https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-telcoin/blob/main/telcoin-audit/contracts/swap/AmirX.sol#L125

1. An attacker or malicious actor could exploit this issue by swapping the same asset that is being used as the fee.
2. By setting a fee that exceeds the swap amount, they could trigger the underflow condition, causing the transaction to fail or revert unexpectedly.

### Impact

The impact of this issue is an underflow, which can result in:

- **Reverted Transactions**: The swap function could fail, causing users to lose gas fees or face transaction errors.
- **Loss of Funds**: If the underflow leads to incorrect balances or failed transfers, users may lose tokens or have their operations disrupted.
- **Service Instability**: Repeated failures in the swap function could lead to a degraded user experience or service downtime.

### Mitigation

To mitigate this issue, ensure that the balance after the swap is checked and verified to be greater than or equal to the balance before the swap. Specifically, add a condition to ensure that the fee is not greater than the available amount to swap and that no underflow occurs during the transaction.
