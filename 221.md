# wrong value being passed in `_buyBack` lead to loss of funds for swapper

### Summary

An incorrect value is being passed in the `_buyBack` function within the `_feeDispersal` of `_defiSwap`. The `SWAPPER_ROLE` is forwarding `msg.value` instead of the contract’s balance, leading to unintended fund losses for the swapper role.

### Root Cause

The function mistakenly forwards `msg.value` instead of `address(this).balance`.

### Internal Pre-Conditions

Executing a defi swap with fee dispersal enabled.

### Attack Path

1. A user initiates a defi swap.
2. The fees for the swap are paid from the funds of the swapper role, rather than being deducted from the user's funds (e.g., AmirX).
3. The remaining funds are sent to `safe`.
4. As a result, the swapper role ends up covering the fees for defi swaps, which is unintended.

### Impact

The `SWAPPER_ROLE` incurs a loss of funds due to covering defi swap fees.

### Proof of Concept (PoC)

[AmirX.sol#L232](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-telcoin/blob/b9c751b59e78a7123a636e31ecafc9147046f190/telcoin-audit/contracts/swap/AmirX.sol#L232)

```solidity
 function _buyBack(
     ERC20 feeToken,
     address aggregator,
     address safe,
     bytes memory swapData
 ) internal {
     if (address(feeToken) == address(0)) return;
     if (address(feeToken) == POL) {
@>       (bool polSwap, ) = aggregator.call{value: msg.value}(swapData);
         require(polSwap, "AmirX: POL swap transaction failed");
```


### Mitigation

To resolve this, replace `msg.value` with `address(this).balance` to ensure the contract's balance is used instead of the caller’s sent value.
