# Underflow Vulnerability in defiToStablecoinSwap due to Unchecked Balance Subtraction

### Summary

The `defiToStablecoinSwap` function in the contract `AmirX.sol` there is vulnerable to an underflow error when calculating ss.oAmount as the difference between `fBalance (final balance) and iBalance (initial balance)`. If fBalance is less than iBalance, this subtraction results in an underflow, setting ss.oAmount to an unintended large value. This could lead to excessive transfers, unexpected contract behavior, or transaction failures, especially in cases where _defiSwap reduces the balance of ss.origin tokens.

### Root Cause

```javascript 
 uint256 fBalance = ERC20(ss.origin).balanceOf(wallet);
        ss.oAmount = fBalance - iBalance;
        //change balance to reflect change
        _stablecoinSwap(wallet, ss);
```

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

This are the following impacts
- Excessive or incorrect token transfers, potentially draining assets or user funds due to an unintended large ss.oAmount value.
- Transaction reverts if _stablecoinSwap or subsequent functions detect an invalid transfer amount.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

To prevent this underflow, add a check that ensures fBalance is not less than iBalance before performing the subtraction. If fBalance is insufficient, the transaction should revert with a clear error message, preventing further execution and maintaining contract integrity.
