# Improper `_verifyDefiSwap` Validation Leading to Potential Fund Mismanagement

### Summary

A logical error in `_verifyDefiSwap` validation in the `AmirX` contract will cause potential fund mismanagement, as `_verifyDefiSwap` does not validate the `defiSafe` address. This missing check could result in misdirected or lost funds during DeFi operations, particularly if the `defiSafe` address is set incorrectly or unintentionally to a non-functional or invalid address.

### Root Cause

In `AmirX`, the `_verifyDefiSwap` function lacks validation for `defiSafe`, the designated safe address for receiving funds. Unlike `_verifyStablecoinSwap`, which verifies all critical addresses (including safe addresses), `_verifyDefiSwap` omits this check, risking unintended fund allocation during DeFi transactions.
