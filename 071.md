# Incorrect Token Treatment by MAINTAINER_ROLE

### Summary

The current design in `StablecoinHandler.sol` allows for the `MAINTAINER_ROLE` to update `XYZ` token settings after `AmirX` has begun transactions, potentially causing unintended token treatment. If a token is initially treated as a regular `ERC20`, but later updated to be an `XYZ` token, it may lead to discrepancies in supply and behavior for users as the system transitions from transferring tokens to minting/burning them instead.

### Root Cause

In [StablecoinHandler.sol: 281](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-telcoin/blob/b9c751b59e78a7123a636e31ecafc9147046f190/telcoin-audit/contracts/stablecoin/StablecoinHandler.sol#L281), the choice to let the `MAINTAINER_ROLE` update XYZ tokens status at any point causes an inconsistency, as tokens previously treated as regular ERC20's will start being minted or burned.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. `MAINTAINER_ROLE` updates a previously regular `ERC20` token to be an `XYZ` token.
2. Swaps or transfers of this token already occurred before the update.

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. The `MAINTAINER_ROLE` updates the `XYZ` status of a token after transactions have started.
2. The contract begins treating the token as an XYZ, minting/burning rather than transferring, leading to unexpected behavior or locked funds.

### Impact

The protocol experiences inconsistent token handling, potentially resulting in supply discrepancies or trapped funds in the liquidity pool due to mismatched expectations for regular vs. `XYZ` token treatment.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Require that all XYZ tokens be defined before transactions begin on the `AmirX` contract to ensure consistent behavior.
