# `Swapper` Role Incorrectly Uses `msg.value` Causing Potential issues

### Summary

The incorrect usage of `msg.value` in the `_buyBack` function will cause a potential loss for the protocol as the `SWAPPER_ROLE` user cannot provide `POL` directly, leading to swap failures or possible mismanagement of `POL` funds.

### Root Cause

In [AmirX.sol: 232](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-telcoin/blob/b9c751b59e78a7123a636e31ecafc9147046f190/telcoin-audit/contracts/swap/AmirX.sol#L232), `msg.value` is used to conduct swaps for `POL` tokens, which should instead use `address(this).balance`.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. `SWAPPER_ROLE` calls `_buyBack` for a fee buyback operation using `POL`.
2. The protocol holds a `POL` balance from previous transactions or collected fees.

### External pre-conditions

1. The aggregator expects a non-zero POL amount to execute the swap successfully.
2. `SWAPPER_ROLE` is unable to send `msg.value` as part of the contract transaction, causing failure.

### Attack Path

1. The `SWAPPER_ROLE` initiates `_buyBack` with `POL` selected as feeToken.
2. `_buyBack` calls the aggregator using `msg.value`, which will be zero from the caller (`SWAPPER_ROLE`).
3. The transaction fails or completes without using the `POL` balance on the contract, causing a failed buyback or remaining `POL` in the contract.

### Impact

The protocol suffers a potential loss of POL due to failed swaps or inconsistent buyback behavior, as `SWAPPER_ROLE` cannot complete swaps correctly.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Use `address(this).balance` instead of `msg.value` for POL transactions within `_buyBack`.

```solidity
function _buyBack(ERC20 feeToken, address aggregator, address safe, bytes memory swapData) internal {
    if (address(feeToken) == POL) {
        uint256 polBalance = address(this).balance; <<<<@
        (bool polSwap, ) = aggregator.call{value: polBalance}(swapData); <<<<@ remove msg.value
        require(polSwap, "AmirX: POL swap transaction failed");
    }
}
```
