# AmirX should not use the `initializer` modifier

### SUMMARY

`AmirX` is a swap contract that intended to be inherited by MockAmirX, therefore it's initializer function should not use the Initializer modifier, instead, it should use onlyInitializing modifier.

### Root Cause

In the [[AmirX.sol:56](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-telcoin/blob/main/telcoin-audit/contracts/swap/AmirX.sol#L56) contract, the initialize function uses the initializer modifier. This is incorrect for a contract like MasterAMO, which is meant to be inherited by other contracts, such as [[MockAmirX]](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-telcoin/blob/main/telcoin-audit/contracts/swap/test/MockAmirX.sol#L48).

According to the OpenZeppelin documentation , the onlyInitializing modifier should be used to allow initialization in both the parent and child contracts. The onlyInitializing modifier ensures that when the initialize function is called, any contracts in its inheritance chain can still complete their own initialization.

A modifier that defines a protected initializer function that can be invoked at most once. In its scope, onlyInitializing functions can be used to initialize parent contracts.

### Impact

In this scenario, no direct attack or monetary loss is likely. However, the vulnerability causes a significant operational issue, preventing inheriting contracts from completing initialization. This could lead to a failure in the deployment of critical protocol components, affecting the overall system functionality.

### Mitigation

Replace the initializer modifier in the AmirX contract with the onlyInitializing modifier. This allows the initialize function to be used by both the AmirX and any inheriting contracts during their initialization phase, without conflicting with their individual setup processes.
