# Fees Aren't Taken When _defiSwap Occurs Before _stablecoinSwap

### Summary

Despite having a _feeDispersal mechanism, fees are never taken from the user when doing a _defiSwap alone. Presumably if _stablecoinSwap comes before _defiSwap, amirX will be set as the fee receiver so that fees can be disbursed, but if _defiSwap no fees are taken into the contract and 0 amounts are disbursed to the user.

This may be able to be used to leech referral rewards.

### Root Cause

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-telcoin/blob/main/telcoin-audit/contracts/swap/AmirX.sol#L90 Fees are disbursed within this function based on the balance of the contract, but are not actually taken from the wallet anywhere.

Also occurs in `defiSwap` and `defiToStablecoinSwap`.

### Internal pre-conditions

N/A

### External pre-conditions

N/A

### Attack Path

1. Make a defi swap with yourself as referrer
2. Repeat over and over to gain rewards while not paying any fees

### Impact

Fees will not be taken on any transaction, but may also be able to be used to leech referral rewards by having yourself as the referrer and continually calling without needing to pay any fees.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Take tokens from the wallet for fees.
