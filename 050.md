# Native Tokens Will Not Be Used as a Fee Token for the DeFi Swap.

### Summary

The fee of a Defi swap is paid to the protocol by users. Although the Defi swap is initiated by swappers, they do not pay any fee themselves. However, the `AmirX::_buyBack()` function incorrectly uses `msg.value` instead of `address(this).balance`, preventing native tokens (MATIC) from being used as a fee token.


### Root Cause

The [AmirX::_buyBack()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-telcoin/blob/main/telcoin-audit/contracts/swap/AmirX.sol#L224-L253) function is implemented as follows:
```solidity
    function _buyBack(
        ERC20 feeToken,
        address aggregator,
        address safe,
        bytes memory swapData
    ) internal {
        if (address(feeToken) == address(0)) return;
        if (address(feeToken) == POL) {
232:        (bool polSwap, ) = aggregator.call{value: msg.value}(swapData);
            require(polSwap, "AmirX: POL swap transaction failed");

            if (address(this).balance > 0) {
                (bool success, ) = safe.call{value: address(this).balance}("");
                require(success, "AmirX: POL send transaction failed");
            }
        } else {
            ------ SKIP ------
        }
    }
```
As shown, the function uses `msg.value` instead of `address(this).balance` when calling aggregator to buy back the fee as Telcoin.
This implies that the swapper must pay the fee, as the swapper is the one calling the Defi swap function. This seems to be a misunderstanding by the developers, as the fee should be paid by the user's wallet in the following section of the Defi swap process:
```solidity
    function _defiSwap(address wallet, DefiSwap memory defi) internal {
        //user's interaction
168:    (bool walletResult, ) = wallet.call{value: 0}(defi.walletData);
        require(walletResult, "AmirX: wallet transaction failed");

        _feeDispersal(defi);
    }
```
As a result, the `_buyBack()` function should use `address(this).balance` instead of `msg.sender` in line 232.

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. A user wants to swap `eUSD` in their wallet for `USDC`, paying the fee in native tokens (MATIC).
2. A swapper calls `AmirX::defiSwap()` on behalf of the user but the swapper doesn't send any MATIC with the transaction.
3. The fee is transferred from user's wallet to the contract as MATIC in line 168.
4. The aggregator fails to convert the fee to Telcoin because `msg.sender` is zero.
5. As a result, the Defi swap fails.


### Impact

Users can't use the native tokens (MATIC) to pay the fee for Defi swap.


### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

It is recommended to use `address(this).balance` instead of `msg.sender` in the `AmirX::_buyBack()` function.
