# `util::abstract::Blacklist.sol` has `renounceRole` function from OpenZepellin's `AccessControlUpgradeable.sol` that can be called to make the blacklist useless

### Summary

The `Blacklist` contract inherits from OpenZeppelinâ€™s `AccessControlUpgradeable`, which provides a `renounceRole` function allowing any account to renounce roles it has been assigned. This allows the assignee to renounce the `BLACKLISTER_ROLE`, effectively removing their authority to enforce blacklist restrictions. This undermines the blacklist functionality.

### Root Cause

This is a public function in the OpenZeppelin's `AccessControlUpgradeable.sol` contract.
https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts-upgradeable/blob/ee3a7e4f38c62bcd22727489218b29f3b893594a/contracts/access/AccessControlUpgradeable.sol#L178C1-L184C6

```javascript
function renounceRole(bytes32 role, address callerConfirmation) public virtual {
        if (callerConfirmation != _msgSender()) {
            revert AccessControlBadConfirmation();
        }

        _revokeRole(role, callerConfirmation);
    }
```
The role assignee can use this function as it is public, and renounce the BLACKLISTER_ROLE, making the blacklist useless.

### Internal pre-conditions

### External pre-conditions

### Attack Path

- The role assignee calls the `renounceRole` function within the `Stablecoin.sol` contract. It can also be called by an attacker, assuming the wallet was somehow compromised.
- He can successfully renounce his `BLACKLISTER_ROLE`, effectively removing their authority to enforce blacklist restrictions, bricking the blacklist system.

### Impact

This bug critically undermines the functionality of the blacklist system. Since the `BLACKLISTER_ROLE` can be renounced, the blacklist is rendered ineffective.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Override the `renounceRole` function to prevent attacker from renouncing the role. Implement the following code to restrict `renounceRole` functionality:

```javascript
function renounceRole(bytes32, address) public virtual override {
    revert OperationNotAllowed();
}
```

This modification ensures that anyone cannot renounce the `BLACKLISTER_ROLE`, preserving the integrity of the blacklist functionality.
