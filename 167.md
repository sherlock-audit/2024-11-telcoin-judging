# AmirX Balance Calculation Underflow Forces Revert on Standard DeFi Trades

### Summary

The **balance calculation logic** in the `AmirX` contract will cause **transaction failures** for legitimate **DeFi swaps**. This issue arises because **users cannot execute trades** where the **output amount** is **less than the input amount**.

### Root Cause

In `AmirX.sol:92-97`, the **balance difference calculation** `fBalance - iBalance` will **revert on underflow** when the **final balance** is **less than the initial balance**. This occurs because the protocol doesn't support **decreases in token amounts** during **DeFi swaps**.
```solidity
 function defiToStablecoinSwap(
        address wallet,
        StablecoinSwap memory ss,
        DefiSwap memory defi
    ) external payable onlyRole(SWAPPER_ROLE) whenNotPaused {
        // checks if defi will fail
        _verifyDefiSwap(wallet, defi);
        // checks if stablecoin swap will fail
        _verifyStablecoinSwap(wallet, ss);

        //check balance to adjust second swap
        uint256 iBalance = ERC20(ss.origin).balanceOf(wallet);
        _defiSwap(wallet, defi);
       @>>> uint256 fBalance = ERC20(ss.origin).balanceOf(wallet);
  @>>>>      ss.oAmount = fBalance - iBalance;
        //change balance to reflect change
        _stablecoinSwap(wallet, ss);
    }
 
```

### Internal pre-conditions

-The user must have an initial token balance greater than 0.
-DeFi swap must result in receiving fewer tokens than input.

### External pre-conditions

User starts with 1000 token
User attempts legitimate DeFi swap expecting 980 token
Contract records initial balance.

Contract records final balance (fBalance = 980 )
Transaction reverts when calculating fBalance - iBalance due to underflow protection

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

Users cannot execute legitimate DeFi swaps where receiving fewer tokens is expected . This severely limits protocol functionality as most DeFi trades involve some reduction in the token amount.



### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Consider using a different mechanism to track and verify swap amounts
