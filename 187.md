# Missing Liquidity Check in StablecoinHandler Allows for Potential Pool Drain and Denial of Service (DoS)

### Summary

In [StableCoinHandler](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-telcoin/blob/main/telcoin-audit/contracts/stablecoin/StablecoinHandler.sol) _verifyStablecoinSwap  184Line

The lack of a liquidity check (i.e., verifying poolBalance >= tAmount) before minting or swapping tokens can result in attempting to mint or swap more tokens than the contract has in reserve. This can lead to failed transactions or even unintended behavior within the contract, especially if there is no safeguard against running out of target tokens.

### Root Cause

In [StableCoinHandler](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-telcoin/blob/main/telcoin-audit/contracts/stablecoin/StablecoinHandler.sol) _verifyStablecoinSwap  184Line there is a missing check for if the pool has enough amount to exchange the user amount

The root cause of this issue is the absence of a validation step that confirms whether the contract has enough target tokens (poolBalance) to fulfill the requested tAmount for the swap. Without this check, the contract proceeds with the mint or swap operation based solely on the amount specified in the StablecoinSwap struct, assuming it has adequate reserves when that might not be the case.

### Internal pre-conditions

Roles to be set

### External pre-conditions


1. User needs to call stableCoinSwap inputting wallet and 
```solidity
         address liquiditySafe;
        address destination; //@note //where the swapped currency will go (Address)
        address origin; //@note user providing for swap currency
        uint256 oAmount;// @note // amount of the currency that user provides
        address target; //@note currency that user wants to receive
        uint256 tAmount; //@note amount that wants to receive
      address stablecoinFeeCurrency; //@note currency that fee will be paid in
        address stablecoinFeeSafe; //@note The address where the fee for the swap should be sent
        uint256 feeAmount; //@note amount of fee that will be got
    }
   
 ```
 
2. _verifyStablecoinSwap  where some checks are done and where this check about the amount is missing
    
    

### Attack Path

1. Repeated Calls to Drain Liquidity: The attacker could repeatedly initiate swaps or minting functions, draining the contractâ€™s pool without regard to the actual token balance. Each swap might succeed until the pool is emptied, at which point future swaps would fail for other users.

2.Excessive Minting: If the protocol is designed to mint or swap tokens on-demand, an attacker could initiate a large swap amount that exceeds the available pool, potentially causing an erroneous or unintended state if the contract tries to mint tokens or if it reverts improperly.

3.Denial of Service (DoS): By draining the pool, an attacker could trigger a DoS scenario, where legitimate users can no longer access liquidity for swaps due to depleted reserves.

### Impact

1. Liquidity Drain: If the contract does not check and continues issuing tokens despite a low reserve, it could deplete its pool, resulting in a state where no users can complete swaps.

2.Debt or Insolvency: For protocols where swaps are expected to be backed by reserves, a lack of sufficient checks could put the system in a debt state, as it owes users tokens that it cannot actually fulfill.

3.System Instability: Without proper liquidity checks, users could attempt transactions that fail unexpectedly, reducing trust in the system's stability and reliability.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Adding a check to ensure poolBalance >= tAmount before initiating the swap is essential to safeguard against these issues. This check should be part of the _verifyStablecoinSwap function or directly within the swap logic, so it prevents any swap attempt when liquidity is insufficient. Additionally, rate-limiting or controls on large swaps could help reduce the risk of rapid liquidity depletion from malicious actors.

```solidity
require(
    poolBalance >= tAmount,
    "StablecoinHandler: Insufficient target token liquidity"
    );
```
