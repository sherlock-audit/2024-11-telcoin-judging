# Incorrect Fee Handling Due to `msg.value` Mismanagement

### Summary


A design flaw in how the contract handles `msg.value` will cause incorrect fee handling for POL transactions, as the contract relies on `msg.value` to pay the fee before the swap is completed, which is not appropriate. This mismatch can lead to **overcharging** or **undercharging** the swapper, resulting in **unexpected fund loss** for users.

### Root Cause


The choice to use `msg.value` to handle fees for POL transactions is a mistake, as the actual fee is determined **after** the swap completes. This will cause the contract to either overcharge or undercharge users, depending on whether `msg.value` is set incorrectly.

- In `AmirX.sol` : The reliance on `msg.value` to handle fee payments before the swap happens, despite the actual fee being determined after the swap, introduces the logical bug.

```solidity

    function _buyBack(
        ERC20 feeToken,
        address aggregator,
        address safe,
        bytes memory swapData
    ) internal {
        if (address(feeToken) == address(0)) return;
        if (address(feeToken) == POL) {
            (bool polSwap, ) = aggregator.call{value: msg.value}(swapData);
            require(polSwap, "AmirX: POL swap transaction failed");

            if (address(this).balance > 0) {
                (bool success, ) = safe.call{value: address(this).balance}("");
                require(success, "AmirX: POL send transaction failed");
            }
        } 
```

### Internal pre-conditions

1. The user must call the swap function with `POL` as the fee token.
2. The user must set the `msg.value` correctly, assuming it will match the fee expected by the contract (which will not happen).
3. The contract must attempt to handle fees using `msg.value` before the swap completes.



### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. A user initiates a swap with `POL` as the fee token, assuming the `msg.value` they send will cover the fee.
2. The contract attempts to use `msg.value` to pay for the fee before the swap is executed.
3. After the swap, the contract determines the actual fee, which could differ from the `msg.value` initially sent.
4. If `msg.value` is set incorrectly, the contract either:
   - Overcharges the user (if `msg.value` is more than required), or
   - Undercharges the user (if `msg.value` is less than required).
5. This results in the contract either holding more funds than needed (loss of funds for the user) or failing to collect the correct fee.


### Impact


The user suffers an approximate loss of POL due to incorrect fee collection. The contract may either:
- Overcharge the user, leading to fund loss for the user, or
- Undercharge the user, failing to collect the full fee and causing operational issues for the protocol.


### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

- **Use Contract Balance for POL Fees**: Instead of relying on `msg.value` for fee payments, the contract should use its **POL balance** after the swap completes to handle the fee payment, ensuring accuracy.
- **Remove `msg.value` Dependency**: Modify the contract to handle `POL` fees using the contractâ€™s balance, consistent with how ERC20 fees are handled, to avoid overcharging or undercharging users.
