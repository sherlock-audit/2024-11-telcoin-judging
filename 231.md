# Malicious wallet may easily grief `SWAPPER_ROLE` by a significant margin leading to severe loss of funds

### Summary

The wallet specified in swaps is supposed to be treated like a gnosis multisig for the purpose of the audit, which means users may send transactions themselves to this wallet before the `SWAPPER_ROLE` [swaps](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-telcoin/blob/main/telcoin-audit/contracts/swap/AmirX.sol#L73).

As the wallet does not support permit functionality, it requires pre approving the protocol that is going to do the swap for tokens to do `AmirX.defiSwap()` or `StablecoinHandler::_stablecoinSwap()` from the `wallet` to the `liquiditySafe`.

As such, the owners of the wallet may frontrun the `SWAPPER_ROLE` and set approval of these tokens to 0, causing significant gas griefing way over the cost of the attack.

### Root Cause

In `AmirX:168`, `(bool walletResult, ) = wallet.call{value: 0}(defi.walletData);` requires the wallet having approved previously the protocol that does the swap. As such, the owners of the wallet may set the approval to 0, frontrunning the `SWAPPER_ROLE` and making this revert.

### Internal pre-conditions

None.

### External pre-conditions

None.

### Attack Path

1. User requests the `SWAPPER_ROLE` to perform `AmirX:swap()` with directional to true and swapping defi and stablecoin.
2. User frontruns `SWAPPER_ROLE` and sets approval of the wallet of the token to swap to 0.
3. Call reverts only [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-telcoin/blob/main/telcoin-audit/contracts/stablecoin/StablecoinHandler.sol#L163), spending a lot of gas in the meantime but reverting and not sending funds to liquiditySafe.

### Impact

Swapper is griefed for many times more than the wallet. The wallet owner just spends 40-60k gas setting the approval to 0, but the `SWAPPER_ROLE` spends many times that as the revert happens after a lot of gas has already been spent.

### PoC

None.

### Mitigation

The `SWAPPER_ROLE` should verify the appproval on chain before everything or approve the tokens of the wallet atomically.
