# Lack of _disableInitializers in constructor allows unauthorized initialization of upgradeable contract

### Summary

The lack of _disableInitializers() in the constructor exposes the contract to re-initialization attacks, enabling malicious actors to exploit initialization functions and potentially gain control of the contract.

### Root Cause

Upgradeable contracts require _disableInitializers() in the constructor to lock the implementation contract and prevent it from being initialized outside of the intended proxy

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

The contract is susceptible to takeover or manipulation, allowing the attacker to reinitialize state variables to malicious values or Assume privileged roles or ownership of the contract.


### Mitigation

Include _disableInitializers() in the constructor to prevent any re-initialization of the implementation contract
