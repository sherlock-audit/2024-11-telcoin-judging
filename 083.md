# Unauthorized Balance Transfer via Blacklisting

### Summary

The _onceBlacklisted function in Stablecoin.sol allows the transfer of all tokens from a blacklisted user to the caller. This will cause a complete loss of funds for users as a malicious BLACKLISTER_ROLE holder can exploit this function to drain user balances.


### Root Cause

In Stablecoin.sol at line [XX](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-telcoin/blob/main/telcoin-audit/contracts/stablecoin/Stablecoin.sol#L123), the _onceBlacklisted function transfers the entire balance of a blacklisted user to the caller without additional checks or safeguards.

### Internal pre-conditions


1. An account must possess the BLACKLISTER_ROLE.


2. The target user must have a non-zero token balance.



### External pre-conditions

1. The attacker must have the capability to invoke addBlackList on the Blacklist contract.


2. The contract must have sufficient token balance to cover the transfer.

### Attack Path


1. The attacker, holding the BLACKLISTER_ROLE, calls addBlackList(userAddress).


2. The contract executes _onceBlacklisted(userAddress), transferring all tokens from userAddress to the attacker.


3. The user suffers a complete loss of their token holdings.


### Impact

Users suffer a loss of all their tokens as the attacker gains their entire balance.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Restrict Role Assignment: Ensure that the BLACKLISTER_ROLE is granted only to highly trusted accounts, preferably using multi-signature wallets.

Implement Additional Safeguards: Modify _onceBlacklisted to transfer tokens to a designated treasury or burn them instead of transferring to the caller.

Audit Role Management: Regularly audit role assignments and implement time-locks for critical role changes to prevent unauthorized access.
