# Blacklisted user's tokens are transferred to BLACKLISTER_ROLE, which is not tracked ,and not repayed while unBlacklisting the same user

**Vulnerability Detail**

The [`addBlackList`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-telcoin/blob/b9c751b59e78a7123a636e31ecafc9147046f190/telcoin-audit/contracts/util/abstract/Blacklist.sol#L77) function in `Blacklist.sol` blacklists a user and transfers all tokens held by the user to the `BLACKLISTER_ROLE` address that invoked the function, as implemented in the [`_onceBlacklisted`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-telcoin/blob/b9c751b59e78a7123a636e31ecafc9147046f190/telcoin-audit/contracts/stablecoin/Stablecoin.sol#L124) function. However, upon calling [`removeBlackList`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-telcoin/blob/b9c751b59e78a7123a636e31ecafc9147046f190/telcoin-audit/contracts/util/abstract/Blacklist.sol#L92) to remove a user from the blacklist, there is no tracking or repayment of the confiscated funds. This creates a risk of financial loss for users who are mistakenly blacklisted.


**Impact**

Medium. The financial impact on users could be significant if mistakenly blacklisted, though the blacklisting action is limited to a designated role.

Manual Review


**Recommendation**

**_Event Logging During Transfer_**

To address this, it is recommended to emit an event logging the amount of tokens transferred during blacklisting to allow tracking of confiscated funds. Adding an event in `_onceBlacklisted` will create a transparent record of confiscated funds:


```diff
+ event BlacklistConfiscation(address blacklistedUser, address blacklister, uint256 amount);

function _onceBlacklisted(address user) internal override {
+    uint256 confiscatedAmount = balanceOf(user);
       _transfer(user, _msgSender(), balanceOf(user));
+   emit BlacklistConfiscation(user, _msgSender(), confiscatedAmount);
}

```
