# Corruptible storage pattern in multiple contracts

### Summary

All contracts in scope implements an upgradeable contract from OZ. However, those contracts misses `_gap` variable, which can cause corruptible storage when being upgraded.

### Root Cause

`Stablecoin` contract implements `ERC20PermitUpgradeable` and `Blacklist`:
```solidity
contract Stablecoin is ERC20PermitUpgradeable, Blacklist
```
and `Blacklist` also implements `AccessControlUpgradeable`:
```solidity
abstract contract Blacklist is AccessControlUpgradeable
```

The similar applies to `StablecoinHandler` and `AmirX`:
```solidity
abstract contract StablecoinHandler is
    AccessControlUpgradeable,
    PausableUpgradeable

contract AmirX is StablecoinHandler 
```

But `_gap` is missing, when either one of those contracts gets upgraded, it can cause corrupted storage, breaking contract states.
