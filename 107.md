# Hardcoded Storage Slots May Lead to Storage Collisions in Upgradeable Contracts


**Title:** Hardcoded Storage Slots May Lead to Storage Collisions in Upgradeable Contracts

---

**Summary**

The use of hardcoded storage slots in `StablecoinHandler.sol` will cause storage collisions in upgradeable contracts as an overlapping storage slot can corrupt contract state, leading to unexpected behaviors or vulnerabilities.

---

**Root Cause**

In [`StablecoinHandler.sol`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-telcoin/blob/main/telcoin-audit/contracts/stablecoin/StablecoinHandler.sol#L57-L68), at **lines 57-68**, the storage slot is hardcoded using assembly:

```solidity
// Lines  57-68
bytes32 private constant StablecoinHandlerStorageLocation =
    0x38361881985b0f585e6124dca158a3af102bffba0feb9c42b0b40825f41a3300;

function _getStablecoinHandlerStorage()
    private
    pure
    returns (StablecoinHandlerStorage storage $)
{
    assembly {
        $.slot := StablecoinHandlerStorageLocation
    }
}
```

Using a fixed storage slot without ensuring uniqueness can lead to collisions when multiple contracts or inherited contracts use the same slot.

---

**Internal Pre-conditions**

1. **Multiple upgradeable contracts with inheritance**: The project uses multiple contracts that inherit from common base contracts.
2. **Hardcoded storage slots**: Contracts use hardcoded storage slots without a collision prevention mechanism.

---

**Attack Path**

1. **Deploy contracts with overlapping storage slots**: Different contracts inadvertently use the same storage slots.
2. **Storage collision occurs**: Data intended for one contract overwrites data in another.
3. **Contract state corrupted**: Unexpected behaviors and vulnerabilities arise due to corrupted state.

---

**Impact**

Storage collisions can **corrupt contract state**, leading to unexpected behaviors, vulnerabilities, or complete malfunction of the contract. This undermines the reliability and security of the system, potentially resulting in loss of funds or unauthorized access.

---

**Proof of Concept (PoC)**

If another contract in the inheritance chain uses the same storage slot (e.g., a parent contract defines a variable that maps to the same storage slot), variables may overlap, causing functions to operate on incorrect data.

---

**Mitigation**

Use unique and deterministic storage slots to prevent collisions. Instead of hardcoding the storage slot, derive it using a unique identifier:

```solidity
// Replace lines 54-57 with:
bytes32 private constant StablecoinHandlerStorageLocation = keccak256(
    "telcoin.storage.StablecoinHandler"
);
```

Alternatively, use OpenZeppelin's `StorageSlotUpgradeable` utility or similar patterns to manage storage slots safely.
