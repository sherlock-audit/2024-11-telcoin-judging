# Same token for fees and origin for stable coin swap

### Summary



In the `StableCoinHandler::_stablecoinSwap` function, the current implementation allows the  token to be used as fee token for the swap. Problem that could occur here is that if the stable coin is fee on transfer token, it will lead to wrong  computation in the stable coin when the origin and the token for fees is the same.

### Impact

Request could fail sometimes due to not having enough tokens in the wallet for the fees.

### PoC


Let’s walk through a specific example to illustrate the issue in the `StableCoinHandler::_stablecoinSwap` function:

1. **User Initiates Swap**  
   The user initiates a swap transaction using a *stablecoin* token, setting the same stablecoin as both the *origin* (the token being swapped) and the *fee* token. This stablecoin is a *fee-on-transfer* token, meaning a portion of every transaction is automatically taken as a fee by the token contract itself (e.g., 1%).

2. **Fee-on-Transfer Mechanism**  
   In this example, let’s assume the swap requires a total of 100 stablecoins:
   - When 100 stablecoins are transferred from the user, the token contract takes a 1% fee.
   - As a result, only 99 stablecoins are received by the swap function after the fee deduction.

3. **Impact on Swap Validation**  
   Without a mechanism to check the effective balance after the fee deduction:
   - The swap function expects the full 100 stablecoins but only receives 99.
   - This discrepancy can cause the swap to violate defined `minSupply` and `maxSupply` constraints, resulting in an inconsistent state.

### Mitigation

Consider implement check in the _verifyStablecoinSwap to prevent having the same tokens for fees and for origin for the stablecoin swap. And also don’t use fee on transfer as tokens!
