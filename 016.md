# Flaw in `defiToStablecoinSwap` logic can cause zero-amount swaps and unintended Behavior

### Summary

In the `AmirX` contract, there is a potential issue in the `defiToStablecoinSwap` function where the logic for setting the output amount (`ss.oAmount`) after performing a DeFi swap does not validate if the balance change is zero. This can lead to unintended behavior in downstream operations, such as conducting a stablecoin swap with an incorrect or zero amount.

### Root Cause

The `defiToStablecoinSwap` function calculates the difference between `fBalance` and `iBalance` after a DeFi swap to set `ss.oAmount`, but it does not check if this difference is zero. This lack of validation can result in a stablecoin swap being executed with an incorrect or zero `oAmount`, which may cause inconsistent behavior compared to the `swap` function.

In `defiToStablecoinSwap` function,

In `swap` function,

`swap` function can do functionalities like `defiToStablecoinSwap`, `stablecoinToDefiSwap`, `defiSwap` by changing paramters.

### Internal pre-conditions

- The `defiToStablecoinSwap` function is called.
- A DeFi swap is successfully executed, modifying the token balance.


### External pre-conditions

- The contract is not paused.
- The caller has the `SWAPPER_ROLE`.
- For `defiToStablecoinSwap` , input parameter `ss.oAmount` is not **ZERO**

### Attack Path

1. A user or malicious actor triggers the `defiToStablecoinSwap` function.
2. The DeFi swap does not result in any balance change (i.e., `fBalance - iBalance` is zero).
3. The function sets `ss.oAmount` to **zero** and proceeds with the `_stablecoinSwap` operation.
4. In `_stablecoinSwap`, if `ss.oAmount` is zero, the function might still attempt to burn or transfer zero tokens:
   ```solidity
   if (isXYZ(ss.origin)) {
       Stablecoin(ss.origin).burnFrom(wallet, ss.oAmount);
   } else {
       ERC20PermitUpgradeable(ss.origin).safeTransferFrom(
           wallet,
           ss.liquiditySafe,
           ss.oAmount
       );
   }
   ```
   This can result in unintended behavior, triggering unexpected contract operations.

### Impact

- The `ss.oAmount` being zero can lead to:
  - Users can get target stable coin without burning.
  - Potential issues when zero-amount burns or transfers are attempted.
  - Users potentially expecting a swap result but receiving none, causing confusion and inefficiency.
  

### PoC

```solidity
uint256 iBalance = ERC20(ss.origin).balanceOf(wallet);
_defiSwap(wallet, defi); // DeFi swap that does not change balance
uint256 fBalance = ERC20(ss.origin).balanceOf(wallet);
assert(fBalance - iBalance == 0); // Condition met
_stablecoinSwap(wallet, ss); // Executes with zero `ss.oAmount`
```

### Mitigation

Add a condition to check if `fBalance - iBalance` is non-zero before assigning it to `ss.oAmount` and calling `_stablecoinSwap`:
```solidity
uint256 iBalance = ERC20(ss.origin).balanceOf(wallet);
_defiSwap(wallet, defi);
uint256 fBalance = ERC20(ss.origin).balanceOf(wallet);

if (fBalance - iBalance != 0) {
    ss.oAmount = fBalance - iBalance;
}
_stablecoinSwap(wallet, ss);
```
This ensures that the stablecoin swap only proceeds if there is a valid output amount, preventing zero-amount burns or transfers and aligning the behavior with that of the `swap` function.
