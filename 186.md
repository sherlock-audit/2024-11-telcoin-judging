# Swapper Role will lose funds due to flowed logic

### Summary

during `_buyBack` in `_feeDispersal` in `_defiSwap` the swapper role is forwarding `msg.value` although it should be the balance of the contract, leading to loss of funds to swapper role or txn reverts

### Root Cause

doing `msg.value` instead of `this.balance`

### Internal pre-conditions

There is fees need to be dispersed

### External pre-conditions

None
### Attack Path

User doing a defiswap

Fees paid are paid by the swapper role not the funds of user AmirX

Remainer of funds are sent to `safe`

Leading to swapper role paying for defiswaps fees which is not intended
### Impact

loss of funds for swapper role

### PoC
in Line 233 is the mistake

```solidity
File: AmirX.sol
225:     function _buyBack(
226:         ERC20 feeToken,
227:         address aggregator,
228:         address safe,
229:         bytes memory swapData
230:     ) internal {
231:         if (address(feeToken) == address(0)) return;
232:         if (address(feeToken) == POL) {
233:             (bool polSwap, ) = aggregator.call{value: msg.value}(swapData);
234:             require(polSwap, "AmirX: POL swap transaction failed");
235: 
236:             if (address(this).balance > 0) {
237:                 (bool success, ) = safe.call{value: address(this).balance}("");
238:                 require(success, "AmirX: POL send transaction failed");
239:             }
240:         } else {
241:             // zero out approval
242:             feeToken.forceApprove(aggregator, 0);
243:             feeToken.safeIncreaseAllowance(
244:                 aggregator,
245:                 feeToken.balanceOf(address(this))
246:             );
247: 
248:             (bool ercSwap, ) = aggregator.call{value: 0}(swapData);
249:             require(ercSwap, "AmirX: token swap transaction failed");
250: 
251:             uint256 remainder = feeToken.balanceOf(address(this));
252:             if (remainder > 0) feeToken.safeTransfer(safe, remainder);
253:         }
254:     }
```

### Mitigation

do `address(this).balance`
