USDT (Tether) and some other ERC20 tokens have a known issue where if an allowance is already set to a non-zero value, you cannot approve a new amount greater than 0 without first resetting the existing allowance to 0

This performs the transfer of tokens from the wallet to the liquiditySafe. However, there is no check or reset of the allowance before making this transfer

additionally the sponsor confirmed that theres a remaining approval balance
