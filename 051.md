# defiToStablecoinSwap() could make system's owner lost token

### Summary

Let look at how the function calculate ss.oAmount before making a call to _stablecoinSwap

```solidity
function defiToStablecoinSwap(
        address wallet,
        StablecoinSwap memory ss,
        DefiSwap memory defi
    ) external payable onlyRole(SWAPPER_ROLE) whenNotPaused {
        // checks if defi will fail
        _verifyDefiSwap(wallet, defi);
        // checks if stablecoin swap will fail
        _verifyStablecoinSwap(wallet, ss);

        //check balance to adjust second swap
        uint256 iBalance = ERC20(ss.origin).balanceOf(wallet);
        _defiSwap(wallet, defi);
        uint256 fBalance = ERC20(ss.origin).balanceOf(wallet);
        ss.oAmount = fBalance - iBalance;
        //change balance to reflect change
        _stablecoinSwap(wallet, ss);
    }
```
The ss.tAmount is predefined before the transaction is executed, however ss.oAmount is calculated in the execution so ss.oAmount could be any value like 1, 2... So ss.oAmount could be not as expected number that suitable with ss.tAmount. 



### Root Cause

In AmirX.sol ,ss.oAmount is not verified after making _defiSwap(), we need to make sure ss.oAmount need to be in a pre-defined range.

### Internal pre-conditions

None

### External pre-conditions

The _defiSwap() function is expected to call to an external exchange contracts. The external contract can also be updated in other transaction (before the current transaction with a call to defiToStablecoinSwap(). For example, Telcoin expects ss.oAmount after _defiSwap() is 10 token, however because of the logic update in the external contract, Telcoin only receives 1 token. 

### Attack Path

There are some possible scenario, for example
1. There is an upgrade to the external contract that used by _defiSwap() (or it is hacked)
2. The defiToStablecoinSwap is called, in this transaction, there is a call to _defiSwap(), _defiSwap() calls to the updated external logic 

### Impact

Telcoin can lost their token

### PoC

None

### Mitigation

After execute: ss.oAmount = fBalance - iBalance;, need a way to check ss.oAmount again to make sure it satisfies the expectation (to match with ss.tAmount)
