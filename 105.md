# Potential Allowance Race Condition Leading to Fund Loss in `AmirX.sol`



**Title:** Potential Allowance Race Condition Leading to Fund Loss in `AmirX.sol`

---

**Summary**

The incorrect use of the `forceApprove` pattern in the `_buyBack` function of `AmirX.sol` will cause a potential loss of funds for the contract as an attacker will exploit the allowance race condition to transfer tokens before the new allowance is set.

---

**Root Cause**

In [`AmirX.sol`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-telcoin/blob/main/telcoin-audit/contracts/swap/AmirX.sol#L241-L245), at **lines 139-142**, the `_buyBack` function uses `forceApprove` to reset and increase the allowance:

```solidity
// Lines 241-245
feeToken.forceApprove(aggregator, 0);
feeToken.safeIncreaseAllowance(
    aggregator,
    feeToken.balanceOf(address(this))
);
(bool aggregatorSuccess, ) = aggregator.call(defi.swapData);
```

This pattern can be unsafe because if an attacker observes the transaction, they can front-run and use the allowance before it is reset, leading to potential token theft.

---

**Internal Pre-conditions**

1. **Attacker monitors pending transactions**: The attacker can observe transactions in the mempool.
2. **Contract uses `forceApprove` without safeguards**: The contract resets allowances in a way that can be exploited.

---

**Attack Path**

1. **Attacker observes allowance reset**: The attacker notices the pending transaction that resets and then increases the allowance to the `aggregator`.
2. **Attacker front-runs transaction**: Before the allowance is reset to zero, the attacker uses the existing allowance to transfer tokens from the contract.
3. **Allowance is increased**: After the attacker's transaction, the contract increases the allowance, and the attacker can potentially exploit this new allowance as well.

---

**Impact**

The contract loses tokens as the attacker transfers them using the manipulated allowances. The attacker gains the stolen tokens, resulting in a **loss of funds for the protocol**.

---

**Proof of Concept (PoC)**

While simulating front-running in a local environment is complex, the vulnerability arises due to the time gap between resetting the allowance to zero and setting it to a new value. An attacker can exploit this window to transfer tokens.

---

**Mitigation**

Avoid using the `forceApprove` pattern. Instead, use `safeApprove` with proper checks to prevent race conditions:

```solidity
// Replace lines 139-142 with:
feeToken.safeApprove(aggregator, 0);
feeToken.safeApprove(aggregator, feeToken.balanceOf(address(this)));
(bool aggregatorSuccess, ) = aggregator.call(defi.swapData);
```

Alternatively, ensure that the token supports the `permit` function (EIP-2612) to set allowances securely without the risk of race conditions.
