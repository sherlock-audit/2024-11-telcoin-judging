# Incompatibility of _stablecoinSwap Function with Gnosis Safe Wallets

### Summary

The _stablecoinSwap function, designed for stablecoin transfers, is incompatible with Gnosis Safe wallets due to the use of safeTransferFrom for token transfers. Gnosis Safe wallets lack private keys and the standard approve mechanism needed for safeTransferFrom operations, as these wallets are smart contracts rather than externally owned accounts (EOAs). Consequently, this function will fail if used with a Gnosis Safe wallet, preventing intended stablecoin swaps or fee transfers.

### Root Cause

**Lack of Support for ERC20Permit:** ERC20PermitUpgradeable might not work directly with a Gnosis Safe since permit functions, which allow approval via signatures instead of standard transactions, also rely on a signing mechanism incompatible with smart contract wallets like Gnosis Safe.

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

This incompatibility prevents users with Gnosis Safe wallets from executing _stablecoinSwap as designed. Any attempted call to this function by a Gnosis Safe wallet will revert, causing the transaction to fail. This impacts systems or applications that rely on _stablecoinSwap to process stablecoin swaps for users holding assets in Gnosis Safe wallets, limiting accessibility and usability.

### PoC

1. Setup: Deploy the _stablecoinSwap function in a smart contract.

2. Test Case:
- Set up a Gnosis Safe wallet.
- Attempt to call _stablecoinSwap using this Gnosis Safe wallet as the wallet parameter.
3. Expected Result: The transaction will revert on the safeTransferFrom call, as the Gnosis Safe wallet cannot perform approve actions for token transfers.
Try this code
```javascript
// Deploy the contract containing `_stablecoinSwap`
// Initialize a Gnosis Safe wallet and fund it with tokens
// Attempt the following call:
_stablecoinSwap(
    gnosisSafeWalletAddress,
    StablecoinSwap({
        stablecoinFeeCurrency: someTokenAddress,
        stablecoinFeeSafe: feeReceiverAddress,
        feeAmount: 1000, // example amount
        origin: someStablecoinAddress,
        oAmount: 1000,
        target: someOtherStablecoinAddress,
        tAmount: 1000,
        destination: destinationAddress,
        liquiditySafe: liquiditySafeAddress
    })
);
// Expected: Transaction fails on `safeTransferFrom` due to missing `approve` for the Gnosis Safe wallet.
```

### Mitigation

To ensure compatibility with Gnosis Safe wallets, refactor _stablecoinSwap to replace safeTransferFrom with transfer calls wherever possible, assuming the tokens are already in the Gnosis Safe wallet.
