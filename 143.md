# Incorrect `DECIMALS_SLOT` Hash Definition Leading to Potential Storage Collision

### Summary

The `DECIMALS_SLOT` storage slot in the Stablecoin contract is assigned an incorrect hash that does not match the EIP-1967 standard for upgradeable contract storage. This incorrect hash increases the risk of storage collisions, potentially allowing unintended overwrites of critical data.

### Root Cause

In [Stablecoin.sol: 27](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-telcoin/blob/b9c751b59e78a7123a636e31ecafc9147046f190/telcoin-audit/contracts/stablecoin/Stablecoin.sol#L27), the `DECIMALS_SLOT` constant is defined with the hash: `0x86386409a65c1a7f963bc51852fa7ecbdb9cad2cec464de22ee4591e1622b46b`

However, this value does not follow the standard `keccak256(abi.encode(uint256(keccak256("eip1967.telcoin.Stablecoin.decimals")) - 1))`, leading to a discrepancy that can cause issues in compatibility and storage integrity.

Actual output is `0x3180a3dfcdfc538aa1917c4a68d1be05fe5a8b984d16f8efa5f8f5e978f9d8cd`

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. During contract upgrades or interactions with storage, the contract might use a different, standard-compliant hash for `DECIMALS_SLOT`.
2. This discrepancy could cause the system to read from or write to unintended storage slots, resulting in data corruption, unexpected behavior, or potential overwrites of critical data.

### Impact

Using a non-standard storage slot increases the risk of storage collision, which could lead to data corruption or unintended storage overwrites, impacting the stability and predictability of the contract's behavior.

### PoC

### Mitigation

Ensure `DECIMALS_SLOT` follows the standard format using `keccak256(abi.encode(uint256(keccak256("eip1967.telcoin.Stablecoin.decimals")) - 1))` to maintain compatibility and prevent potential storage collisions.
