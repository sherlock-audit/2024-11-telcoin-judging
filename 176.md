# A malicious actor might be able to drain the Telecoin XYZ pools by using defiToStablecoinswap through a malicious pair of coins

### Summary

In the `defiToStablecoinSwap` or `swap` (when directional is true) functions, `ss.tAmount` remains fixed regardless of changes in `ss.oAmount`. This means the contract doesn't adjust the amount of XYZ tokens issued based on the actual `ss.oAmount` received. Attackers can manipulate `ss.oAmount` through slippage and liquidity removal, causing the contract to dispense more XYZ tokens than it's supposed to, leading to a loss of funds.

### Root Cause

In defi to stable swaps, the `ss.tAmount` (target amount) is fixed and doesn't change even if `ss.oAmount` (origin amount) varies. 
`ss.oAmount` is set to output of `_defiSwap` which performs an swap using `0x` or `1Inch` aggregators, 0x or 1Inch aggregators return the best possible swap path given a pair of coins (e.g. ETH and USDC).

In swap function, we can see that `ss.tAmount` is fixed, regardless of new `ss.oAmount`:

Also in defiToStablecoinSwap:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-telcoin/blob/main/telcoin-audit/contracts/swap/AmirX.sol#L122-L127

This means that, _no matter what is the result of first swap, as long as the allowed slippage (set in UI) is not exceeded, same `tAmount` is given to user_.

### Internal pre-conditions

- most important condition is that, all coins are allowed to be swapped in _defiSwap, i did not see any validations regarding this in the AmirX contract (it might be done off-chain)

### External pre-conditions

- Attacker monitor memepool and submits a `removeLiquidity` or `swap X to USDC` transaction to his pool, with a higher gas price
- It must be possible to set slippage as high as 49% in the TELECOIN platform

### Attack Path

**An attacker can exploit this by:**
1- Creating a malicious pool with USDC liquidity. lets say 1000 X token and 1000 USDC
2- Initiating a swap on the Telecoin platform to exchange 1000 X token to 1000 USDC and then 1000 XYZ stablecoin.
3- Setting the slippage to maximum (49%) to prevent the swap from failing if `ss.oAmount` is too low, in this case, if `ss.oAmount` is as low as 510$, the swap still goes through
4- Initiating the swap, Telecoin executes a swap with `ss.tAmount` set to `1000 XYZ` coin and `ss.oAmount` to output of `X => USDC` swap
4- Attacker monitors the mempool, right before the Telecoin swap transaction, Removes a portion of liquidity or swaps a huge amount of X tokens for USDC, causing the `wallet` to receive significantly less `USDC` (let say 510$)
5- Despite receiving 510$ USDC, the contract still sends the full `ss.tAmount` of XYZ tokens to the attacker.
6- Attacker spent 510$ USDC, but received 1000$ of  XYZ stablecoin
7- Attacker repeats he process, swaps 1000 of XYZ stablecoin for 1000$ USDC
