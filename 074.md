# Lack Of Rate Limiting in Mint/Burn Operations Lead to Potential Market Manipulation

### Summary

The absence of rate limiting on minting and burning operations allows malicious actors to artificially inflate or deflate token supply, potentially enabling market manipulation and causing significant price volatility.

### Root Cause

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-telcoin/blob/main/telcoin-audit/contracts/stablecoin/Stablecoin.sol#L1-L156
This vulnerability arises due to the lack of mechanism to control the frequency of amount of tokens that can be minted (created) or burned (destroyed) within a specified timeframe therefore allowing unregulated changes to the token supply that impact its value in the market.

### Internal pre-conditions

- No restrictions or limits on the frequency or volume of tokens that can be minted or burned in a single transaction.
- Lack of automated mechanisms to adjust the supply to maintain peg stability in response to fluctuating market conditions.

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

- Monitor on-chain activity for token price fluctuations and identify opportunities to exploit the mint/burn operations.
- Rapidly mint a large volume of tokens to artificially increase supply, potentially leading to a price drop due to a supply shock.
- Conduct profitable trades based on the manipulated price point to exploit price differentials.
- Burn tokens after trade completion to restore the supply, stabilizing the token price at the attacker's discretion.

### Impact

Increased market volatility due to erratic supply adjustments, destabilizing the token's value.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Enforce supply peg mechanisms or stability algorithms to prevent substantial price deviation from an anchor asset (e.g., fiat currency).
